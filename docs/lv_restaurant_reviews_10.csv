The hubby and I went on a Tuesday night and we sat at the bar. We decided on AYCE and that is definitely the way to go. Price is standard at $26.95. 

We ordered side dishes first: grilled yellow tail collar, fried calamari, grilled pork belly and baked green mussels. Baked green mussels were good but not nearly as good as Sin City Sushi. We liked everything for the most part but the grilled pork belly is something special. The pork belly was juicy, flavorful and melted in my mouth.

We mostly stuck with nigiri and everything was fresh with not too much rice. The standouts for me were the super white tuna and snow crab meat. Our chef, Mike, suggested a variety of items to try and one of them was rice, raw quail egg and masago wrapped in seaweed. It was surprisingly yummy. 

The only roll we had lived up to it's name, Ecstacy Roll. I can't even remember what was in it but it was good! I like that you can do half orders.

What bumped this review up to 5 stars for me were the desserts. The hubby had the green tea creme brulee and I had the tempura ice cream. I wasn't too thrilled with the tempura because it was spongy and not at all crunchy. I did, however, eat most of the green tea creme brulee. It had a good consistency and right amount of sweetness. I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth so I ordered the lychee sorbet. It was so yummy and was a great way to cleanse the palette. 

A huge plus was the exceptional service. The sushi chefs were friendly and were gracious enough to suggest different things to try. Our glasses were always full and empty plates were cleared right away. 

I am now a believer of the type. I love that they have a frequent punch card. I expect to get that free 10th meal very soon!",JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA,5,5/25/2011,4,review,2,Sunrise,Buck's Tavern

I've tried both the green & red chile burros, and both were great!  The sauce is very robust and just spicy enough for me (for some probably not spicy enough).  They've got a lot of other offers too, along with lunch specials, and even gringo food. 

It is a pretty small place, but you can takeout and the wait is very minimal.

I'm assuming it gets more business from the corporate workers M-F and then from the patrons from the hotels in the area. However, we decided to stop on in (we drive by it almost every day!).  They have the huge menu with specials on the wall so its easy to decide what you want. We approached the counter to order and the customer service was just such a delight. The person greeted us very warmly and asked if we had any questions. I asked about the coleslaw to see how it was prepared. She let me try a bit of it to make sure I'd like it if I was to order it with the meal. It was pretty good, not really too creamy at all. It was really light. We ended up ordering/sharing the 3 meat platter (to sample 3 of the meats) it came with 2 sides (we got coleslaw and baked beans). It was around $13-$14. But for two people, it was a deal.  So we sat down and they brought it out to us and they had 3 BBQ sauces on the table to choose from (1 honey mustard type/ 1 sweet type and one that had a bit of a kick). They all tasted quite nice. The meat was juicy and looked great. I enjoyed the chicken and pulled pork more that the brisket. The coleslaw was as expected (rather plain, but decent in texture). The beans on the other hand were not so good. They had this creaminess to them, we really didn't like (mushy) and it was rather flavorless. Oh, well, at least we tried them. We didn't order any ice cream, but apparently they make there own. Maybe we will try another time. 
And just a side note, we did have a good experience while were were eating also. The guy behind the counter would try to get the restaurant going with ""How's everyone doing out there, hope you aren't still hungry after all that food you got!"". Things like that to get a laugh out of us. It was really amusing. I like fun and unique places like this. It felt comfortable and it stood out to us. (Not cookie cutter).

It started with a layer of perfectly crispy tater tots (can you teach me how to make them so yummy?), followed by a HUGE mound of braised short rib, perfectly tender and juicy, topped with baby spinach(??), and, to make it ""poutine-like"" drizzled with a cheddar cheese gravy.  I must say, it was DIVINE!  A little hard to eat out of a small dish, but so yummy!!  

Then, I watered it down with a raspberry-basil lemonade!  A subtle flavor of basil that was perfect in the 80-degree weather.  I would say, though, that the limade was too tart for my tastes - I had to reach for the sweetener just to get through the glass.

After tasting the other trucks creations (which were definitely contenders), I left saying the Hodge Podge truck had stolen my heart!

I know, because after a really cursory search of prime rib on Yelp + recommendations of places to check out for prime rib near the Strip, coupled with a very short time allotted for Yelp research, I ended up at Rare 120 and lost some cool points when we discovered they only serve steaks and seafood.

So we unfortunately have to leave after enjoying the nice décor in an almost completely emptied dining area (it was only about 530ish on a Saturday night), view of their impressively looking wine selection, and reading about the wonderfully tasty description of the surf and turf entrees, appetizers and desserts they offer.

The waitstaff was very professional, when they learned that we were actually looking to have prime rib for dinner, and recommended to check out the cafe at Hard Rock as an option.

The large Tom Kha Kai was tasty and served in a pottery hot-pot with a heating element. Pretty cool vessel! Much less utilitarian-looking than the typical stainless bundt-cake pan thing that Thai restaurants serve their large soup in.

Wings: surprisingly cheap. A dozen for $7. But smallish, so don't expect jumbo flappers. Tried 2 flavors: 'Thai BBQ' and the 'Gra-pow Basil'. The 'Thai BBQ' flavor was nondescript, but the 'Gra-pow Basil' wings were very tasty if you like Thai Basil (I do.)

Jungle Curry with Chicken: big disappointment. How can one *not* order the ""Jungle Curry""? Yeah, it sounds awesome but then we all realized that the broth tastes just like the liquid in a can of bamboo shoots. One spoon to the mouth and I was done. I can imagine some idiot local restaurant critic (dressed up in a stupid white penguin suit) saying, ""Oh, I LOVE Jungle Curry. Jungle Curry is the BEST"" just because ""Jungle Curry"" sounds like something you're supposed to like. Don't fall for it. Stick with Panang, Green, Red, Massaman, Pineapple...

Panang Curry w/Steamed Tofu: probably the best of the dishes we ordered. Unfortunately it was served on a huge platter, making spooning the curry impossible without lifting up the plate. A pet peeve - Thai curry should be served in bowls, not on plates. For the record, the curry was no better than say, Thai-style Noodle House or Weera Thai. It was just good to get back to basics after the Jungle Curry letdown.

Duck Curry: pretty good. The duck itself was a little on the dry side. The pineapple curry it was bathed in was savory and sweet as expected. Again, served on a huge platter so it was a challenge keeping the duck on the plate and scooping onto my rice. At $16 this dish is all the money. Probably wouldn't order it again - it wasn't 2X as good as their basic Panang.

Brown Rice: poorly-reheated instant rice mania with a mushy consistency. Ate it only because it came out at the same time as our curries. Same brown rice consistency that Pan Asian serves. I concede that beggars can't be choosers when it comes to Brown Rice. Just glad they have it.

To be fair, we were with other people so we didn't order the whole fish or the steak. Will try these things next time, hopefully inspiring an update.",OOWSVT7NL2BlGuQyzHlvCw,3,7/18/2014,1,review,1,Sunrise,Rilibertos Fresh Mexican Food

In Las Vegas for a conference and with my husband. We went to a few common hot spots on the strip, and we were getting tired of the same old stuff when we stumbled upon Sake Rok.

The appeal of the restaurant pulled us in, and then the excitement of the crowd suggested we made a good decision.

Our server, Tara, was very friendly, and every employee we encountered was naturally enthusiastic. The manager came by to explain a bit more about the story behind the restaurant as well.

We grew to see that everyone in the house was sincerely enjoying themselves. The MC was dressed up and interacting with tables and encouraging sake bomb contests. We were not drinking that evening and there was no pressure to drink or put on the spot to participate either. 

The staff dance and the DJ was ON POINT, mixing in real time with hit songs.

Reasonably priced considering the food was amazing and we looked at all the other plates coming out of the kitchen wanting to return for more. 

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great experience put together by an owner and management with a vision for dining and entertainment excellence.",lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,5,10/19/2016,2,review,2,Northwest,Coco's Bakery & Restaurant

We ordered our food for takeout and waited there while they made it all. The staff was very friendly, which I believe is half the battle. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, which flew by pretty quickly.

We brought home two slices of pizza, lasagna, spaghetti w/ marinara, wings, two salads, a tiramisu and two sodas...all for only $30, which was pretty reasonable for all the food we ordered.

The pizza was great, New York style. I loved the crust! My spaghetti w marinara was delicious. It had great seasoning, fresh garlic, chunky tomatoes. Personally, I like my pasta very saucy, so I might order a little extra sauce next time. The salads were simple but good house salads. The blue cheese dressing is great! I didn't have a chance to try the wings but my boyfriend said they were very good. Now, for the lasagna...that was the star of the show. It was the perfect portions of meat, cheeses, sauce, and the spinach on the bottom layer was the perfect touch. Do yourself a favor and order the lasagna. Oh, and the tiramisu was fantastic as well. I love a good slice of tiramisu and this place has it. They're perfect personal portions, next time I'll order a couple extra ;))).

The food here is obviously made from scratch and the owner deserves all the pride he takes in his food. The great specials and friendly staff will have us coming back.

Then we checked the other Yelp reviews -- nearly everyone gave this place 4 stars -- and rightly so.  We visited the Longhorn Casino at 10 PM on a weekday, a time when you'd go hungry at the much larger Sam's Town casino across the street.

It wasn't the ambience -- Wal-Mart has greeters, this place had a hooker almost blocking the front door, begging for $2 because her ""boyfriend just left her."" And the people behind us somehow managed to have security read them the Trespass Act, photograph them, and boot them off the premises!

The food totally makes up for the ambiance (or utter lack thereof). A lengthy menu features ribs, trout, prime rib, 1-pound burgers, you name it. We had the ribs-chicken-brisket special (not on the menu, on a sign above the cashier); and also the Cajun prime rib. A calendar lists daily specials as well. Finish the 1-pound burger and win an unspecified prize. Creamed chipped beef (""SOS"") is offered 12M-noon for $4. Steak and lobster, prime rib and shrimp, whatever combination suits your fancy, they have it.  The baby back ribs, brisket, and prime rib were tender and succulent; ""Tell them they have great iced tea,"" says the wife. The bill came to $33 of which $8 was for iced tea and side orders of cole slaw and tomatoes. The dinner rolls were homemade.

Among other things we liked, there's no Bataan death-march through a huge casino to get to the restaurant, the total distance was about 50 feet from car to table; and you don't have to sign up for a casino player's card to get their best deals. Speaking of great deals, they have $2 live blackjack and their rules are more liberal than at Sam's Town (among other things they allow resplitting aces and doubling down after splits).",Rxz2YpeLr9Ek54Lt5z6h0A,4,10/24/2013,1,review,2,Southeast,McDonald's

For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.

I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- 

The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.

Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.

Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.

For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!

You pretty much know what you are going to get regardless of which one you go into aside from one thing...how is the staff/service in any given location. So I'm going to mainly talk about that. I was there around 8pm so after the dinner rush however, myself and several others had to wait about 5 minutes while everyone ran around and restocked. I don't know if this was poor planning or just circumstances but several individuals were verbally agrivated. It wasn't ideal and slightly annoying. Not to mention they only had 1 person making the orders from start to finish and then a cashier. The other workers continued to cook/stock while there was a line forming back to the door. The worker making orders was trying to joke with people but it wasn't going over well. For example, the guy behind me asked for a chicken burrito and was told, ""We don't make those. We make quesadillas here."" He was not pleased with the joking especially since he had been waiting for almost 10 minutes by this point. A for effort but probably not the time for jokes.  At least the food I got was fresh. I can't knock them there. They store itself also appeared to be clean and in good condition. 

Like I said, maybe there were some call offs or they had just gotten through a major rush but it looked to me that there was a lot of goofing around going on and they got caught with their pants around their ankles.

Where to start? I will say on a positive note that I loved their salsa (there is the 1 star), however, please don't serve me delicious salsa with stale chips. I know they're free but they should still be fresh.

The wait staff seemed quite confused the entire time. Everyone at my table essentially ordered the same exact meal and they couldn't for the life of them figure out who had what. Not a difficult tasks when two people order chicken and one orders steak.

I went there for lunch and considering I was downtown I figured they'd be a lunch menu or specials read to me and neither were true. There may have been lunch specials, but I was not told them. I think $12.49 is a little expensive when you're on a social lunch

The food in general was so meh. I've been to places with authentic Mexican food. I'm not a person who just eats Taco Bell and says, I love Mexican. I've been to places in Florida and California where you know you're having the real deal and in comparison to that it truly failed. The food was spicy hot, but that's it. I got no other flavor but hot. Give me some spices, not just spicy. I could have easily just added some Frank's red hot to it if I wanted my mouth to burn.  The portions were a good size, however, I didn't want to finish what I did so it size wasn't a factor.

The inside is always clean and nice while also being spacious, much more so than some of their other restaurants.  I actually prefer to come to this location over some of their others because of that and also because it never seems to be super busy.  Half of that is probably because this Qdoba is on one side of McKnight Road which has a center lane divider which can make it a little hard to get to.

The past few times I have been there I have had a steak salad, chicken queso burrito and plain chicken burrito all with brown rice and black beans.   All of it has been really good although it is never exceptional.  What I really like about Qdoba that makes it different from all of the restaurants in the same vein is that they now allow you to get brown rice and also that they have a habernero salsa to put on what you have ordered.  Since I love spicy food, that is huge for me.

We were seated by the owner who pointed out the extensive wine and cocktail lists and departed.  A friendly waitress took our drink order, a bottle of the Axis Zinfandel to split.  

While we were deciding on food, we took in a bit of the ambiance.  It's a beautiful space.  The bar is contemporary but comfortable and separated from the main dining room, which only has twelve or so tables. For some reason I found the dining room to be a bit ""cold.""  Not just in decor, which was very Hilde-from-Trading Spaces (""Color? How about gray?"") but also in physical temperature. Brrr. 

Onto the food.  Boy and I shared the gnocchi with braised short rib as an appetizer.  Delicious, and the second-best gnocchi I've had in Pittsburgh.  For entrees, I chose the ""Surf and Turf"", which was a petit filet with scallops.  The waitress kindly let me switch out the mashed potatoes for risotto.  Although I found it odd that they didn't ask me how I preferred my steak to be cooked, it came out a tender and tasty medium-well. A very well-cooked steak! 

Boy opted for the braised beef short ribs.  In retrospect, I am upset I didn't take a photo of his entree.  It was a HUGE chunk of meat.  As in, Renaissance Fair leg of turkey huge. Although slightly fatty, the ribs were flavorful and tender.  

We split the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was obviously made fresh (and not reheated) so it took a little while to make.  We were in no hurry, and the cake was good, but nothing spectacular. 

Overall, a ""good"" dining experience.  I couldn't decide between three and four stars.  The reason why I ultimately chose the former is because I generally found the environment to be a little ""off.""  The dining room was eerily quiet and cold.  But most importantly, the manager/owner checked on us several times. Or rather, he checked on BOY several times.  Not once did he face and/or talk to me and ask how my dining experience was. Really strange.  I'm curious to see how Truth will do in the future.

The food: the food is awesome! I went with the create your own burger. It was like a chose your own adventure. So many options to chose from. I went with a burger that had grilled onions, horseradish cheese, garlic mayo and probably other things that I have forgotten all on a pretzel bun. The burger was excellent. I prefer my burgers well done and you know it's s good place when they can make a burger juicy and still have it well done. My wife went a pulled fork and cheese curd appetizer. I would call it an American version of poutine. The food was great!!!

The service/manager: first things first, the server was good-friendly, quick to refill beverages, and anything else you expect in a good server. My issue came when the bill arrived.

On their create a burger form there is a bottom part that says you get chips automatically but can sub the chips for something else and they provide you with a list and a price next to anything that would have an up charge. I went with the fries and added jalapeño cornbread. The server looked over the my form and headed to the back. No mention of any issues with it.  I receive my food, enjoy it, and get the bill. I notice on the fries that I substituted were $1.5 up charge (which is fine) and the cornbread (which the menu said was $1.5) shows $3.50. Call the waiter over and tell him the issues. He says, that you can only sub one item and that was the fries. The cornbread is charged at full menu price. I say, there is 1. No mention of that on the menu, 2. There is no mention of how much the full price is. He says he will get the manager. A couple minutes later a gentleman with crazy facial hair comes over. And explains to me the same thing the server said about the second item being charged full price. I state that is mentioned nowhere on the form or even what the full price would be. When I'm done he just stares at me. Waiting for me to admit defeat. After looking at each other for awhile I say, ""well I guess that's that then. Right?"" He says yes and that's how it ends. 

If the menu had said that fine, that's on me. It didn't 1. Say what happens with additional sides or 2. How much they are. A real bait and switch.

I was disappointed with how the manager handled it. And therefore I give 5 stars on the food and 2 on the service. Not sure if I would go back just based on how the post meal went down.",ZARPISrzPW6PrMSwexHnxw,3,5/2/2016,0,review,1,Chinatown,Kapuso Kapamilya

We had a window seat, which was fantastic- I did not ask for this but the staff were aware that it was my husband's birthday and I wonder if they put us there to make things extra-special!

They don't short you on fish, they don't give you huge pieces of rice with your sushi to save money, they don't slow the service down to prevent you from ordering more, and the food's delicious. Around $27 per person for dinner and $22 per person for lunch. 

PRO TIP FOR FATTIES LIKE US: if you order a crap ton of sushi like my family does then sit at the table and not the sushi bar. Sitting at the sushi bar means you order direct from the sushi chef which can be awkward if you place multiple big orders. We sit at the table and place our order from the server which is less awkward. 

The only downside is the wait is crazy long on weekends. They also ran out of uni one evening (included in the dinner price) and wouldn't compensate for this in some way whether through an extra order of sweet shrimp or anything.

If you download their waitlist app you can check how many parties are before you. They call or text parties when their table is ready so most parties wait in their car.

I couldn't believe it and told her how long we had been standing there.  She shrugged her shoulders.  By this time I wanted to leave.  It's a shame that this happened because we really wanted to experience various parts at the hotel.

It's only two strip malls away from my parents' hood (since I'm a visitor and didn't keep track of actual distances, and there are strip malls galore in this area, that's how I keep tabs on locations), and it's a Jewish-sounding deli! Sign me up...

Three of us went for lunch and got sandwiches. My cousin, a 19-year-old macho man terrorizing much of the Phoenix female population currently, got the chicken salad sandwich. He liked it a lot. It was piled high with mayonnaisy (how in the heck should I spell that, sorry) looking chopped chicken. My boyfriend got the roast beef sandwich with cheese and roasted red peppers. He thought it was pretty good, but picked off the red peppers. I tried one, and could see why they wouldn't really fit with the rest -- really pungent tasting, would totally overwhelm and stand out from the other flavors. I got the half sandwich/half salad combo with the thanksgiving turkey sandwich (cranberry spread, yum) on whole wheat, house salad. Eh, just ok. Nothing special. 

This rates ok since it's convenient and serviceable, but really it's not the good Jewish deli I was hoping for, and the prices are pretty high for just a sandwich. I'd rather pick up fixings and make my own at this cost, which is what I did the next day.",7Zmxle5A6XTZACIHgiC98Q,3,8/4/2008,1,review,1,Centennial,Presto Calzone Bakery

The alleged biscuit on my breakfast sandwich was probably yesterday's version of a croissant,  Soggy, flat, gooey.  Yuk.

When we walked in there was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) sitting at the host stand doing a crossword - he stopped promptly and seated us. 

The atmosphere was cute, we sat outside on the patio and looked over the paper menu while we waiting for our server (you think they could afford to at least laminate the things). When our server came I asked about the Over Easy Ice (basically an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk and spices) and he pretty much had no clue what I was talking about - he didn't know the menu at all.

We started with the raz cranberry scone with vanilla bean creme freche. It came to the table drizzled in honey and had a huge mound of the cheese on it. As soon as I took a bite I was dissapointed. The scone was stale, like, second day stale. What a bummer, especially because it totally had the potential to be really amazing.

I ordered the mushroom scallion cheese omelette. It was something you would find a Denny's for a lot less. Greasy, greasy, greasy. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with asparagus - he liked it. His meal was pretty much the only good thing on the table. He got the sourdough toast, which came dry without any butter - not even on the side. It was left untouched on the table.

- DO NOT USE MORE CHAIRS THAN THAT ALLOTED TO YOUR PARTY

- DO NOT STEP MORE THAN 2 IN. AWAY FROM WALL WHILST IN LINE FOR ELEVATOR
o You may be physically pushed (female, or not) if you step out of line
o Member of staff may not hesitate to demean and degrade you with terribly inappropriate language

But I'm going to post anyways.  I had been wanting to try Roy's since going to Hawaii a few months ago and never had the chance to go.  So when we drove into Vegas and picked up my parents at the airport we checked into our hotel, took showers and started walking to Roys.  The walk took a bit longer than anticipated - little over 30 minutes.  I called the restaurant and told them I was running late for my reservation.  The hostess told me they stopped serving food at 9:30 and closed at 10.  I ended up pretty much jogging the last 5 minutes to the restaurant to make sure we got there on time and left my husband and parents walking behind.  I got there at exactly 9:33. Basically, if we would have gotten there at 9:29 we would have been seated.  They refused to serve us anything but dessert.  When I explained I had been wanting to eat at Roy's for months, and my parents had been traveling for 8 hours, and we had been driving for about as many, and had just walked 30 minutes to get there - me jogging at the end - and just really wanted some hot food, the manager said - 'well, some of our desserts are hot'.

Whether it was 4 guys in a she she restaurant or not being on an expense account, boy did we pick the wrong venue!  We all enjoy quality food and a good time.  When the waiter, who was MIA most of the night, asked us if we had ever been there before, it would have been a great idea for him to mention how petite the portions were.  Instead he mentioned something about family style.  We ordered the calamari which he suggested.  It was cut in 4 pieces the size of the tip of my pinky.  It was a joke for $26.  really, $26.  Could he have mentioned that we should get several apps due to the size?  YES!  I felt like a complete idiot for picking this item for us to order.  As there were several folks serving our table, on a few occasions they had to be reminded that we had ordered another drink and this seemed pretty disappointing based on the type of restaurant we were visiting.  The main course of salmon was fine, but nothing different than my wife prepares at home.  My friends dishes were also fine, but we all had that sinking feeling that we would need to go out to dinner after we left the restaurant as the portions were so small.  I don't normally eat much bread and instead consumed 3 pieces as a way to fill my belly.  While we all made jokes about the experience and left happy and laughing, the portions, prices and disheveled wait staff made it a memorable experience, in a bad way.  While we are all good wage earners, either back up the excessive pricing with decent value (portions) or don't charge so much.  I can't really stomach spending over $100 a person for 2 drinks, 1 app shared and 1 entree, and poor service.  It was stupid.

It's not been easy moving to Western PA from the Bay Area, and I'd really hoped this would function as one way to get Middle Eastern food in the area. We've been twice, and have come away disappointed both times. 

Positives: god service, clean, some meats are well cooked, the hummus is great, and freshly squeezed orange juice that is what it says it is. 

Negatives: 
1. For starters, I just don't understand how they can serve this really dry, generic pita without anything: no olive oil, yogurt, hummus, nothing. I've never encountered this in any Middle Eastern context. How can they do this?  
2. Their salads are bad. Both times I've been served sub-par salad greens: wilting, dry, stale. 
3. The lamb plate was a disappointment: too dry. I got a combo plate today, and the meat was very inconsistent: some medium rare, others well done. My husband's hummus shawarma plate had very well done meat.
4. Finally, I have a very bad aftertaste from the food today: something very canny and unpleasant. I think it may have been the meat or the vermicelli. Either way, we will not be going back. Which is just too bad.",y19xFolCozaRA-gGmHwkQA,2,4/24/2015,0,review,0,The Strip,Outback Steakhouse

As soon as I arrived here, I asked if they served aguas frescas (Mexican drinks like jamaica or horchata) and they stared at me like my face was on backwards. So that did not bode well.

The food is not bad, and the decor is acceptable. The servers were pleasant, but not super fast. There is really nothing authentic tasting here. It tastes like a lot of the more notable flavors of Mexican cuisine have been muted for a less adventurous audience. The beans and rice are passable, and the other dishes are fine - hot, clean, etc. They just don't get it done as authentic, and don't mess with the formula enough to cut it as worthwhile for the trip. 

While some people might make asinine comments like ""Drive 2000+ miles to California if you want good Mexican food,"" that is sadly not a realistic option. And while it may be snobby to expect a Mexican place to serve passable Mexican food, it would not be accurate to rate it as great and mislead the fine folks of Pittsburgh about what kind of Mexican food they are getting.

I have visited this place 4 times now.

First trip: with my wife and daughter.
Food was good, egg rolls good, then main course. It took 20 minutes for then to bring us 1 pho (for my wife), and 1 rice vermicelli with pork (only dish I ever eat).
My dish was good, and seemed like the portion was big, until my pork disappeared and the only thing left was lettuce. I think they included a small head of lettuce, little bit of noodles, and a tiny amount of meat.

Second trip: by myself since my wife delivered our second baby girl, and I wanted to surprise her with comfort food.
Ordered a chicken Pho, and kids chicken Pho (for my daughter) to go.
Server girl tells me that they do not make kids pho to go. Now I'm mad, but don't want to make a scene. I ask if I can get a side of noodles to go, in which she says ""yes"". I ask if I can get a small side of pho soup to go, in which she says ""yes"". Chicken? ""yes""
I'm thinking WTF is different from child's pho than what I ordered?
Took my order and left no tip due to her stupidity!

Third trip: with my wife, mom, and our now two daughters.
Pretty much same order as first trip, but my mom ordered same as me.
My wife, being Vietnamese didn't learn English until her late teens, always orders in Vietnamese (hey we are in a Vietnamese restaurant right?). I guess either the server we had didn't know Vietnamese, or was of a different nationality because no matter what my wife said, she ignored my wife and kept asking ""what number?""
Again my food (and my moms) was pretty much a whole head of lettuce, little noodles, and little meat.

Fourth trip: with my wife, our two daughters, my mom, and my moms husband.
Almost same order as last time, but I ordered rice vermecilli with beef, my mom and my wife order it with pork, and my step father orders pho.
All of our food comes out, and again a whole head of lettuce, bla bla bla.
But wait, my wife's food is not here, and the server is at the othe side of the place laughing and chatting with friends. Everyone is pretty much finished, and still no food for my wife. I go get the server and tell her that my wife didn't get her food. She comes over and tells my wife that she is not sure what happened. She goes to the kitchen, then comes back and says she forgot to order it for us, but put it in now. My wife tells her ""okay, please remember it needs to be Pork. 
A little bit later the server brings her rice vermecilli with beef.
My wife tells her ""I ordered Pork, and I reminded you that it was pork"". 
The server tells my wife ""no, you order beef. I heard you say beef"".
Then almost at the same time, my mom and I tell her very loudly ""I ORDERED BEEF, AND IT WAS OVER 30 MINUTES AGO!!!"". 
So now the server is just standing there mumbling something, but does not offer to fix it or anything, she just keeps standing there. 
So my mom says she will eat the beef, and we will take the rest home and add pork to it for my wife. 
As I dump it into a to go box, my wife says ""wow, that must be a whole head of lettuce there"". Finally I was not the only one to notice.
My mom offered to pay, and as we were walking out, the owner says ""do you want me to replace meat with pork?""

Even though the food was descent tasting, we will never go back there again after those repeated experiences.

I decided on the mac and cheese because 1. I love love love cheese and pasta and 2. Their lobster is flown in fresh in everyday which is appealing. The macaroni was so cheesy and I devoured it in 5 minutes. It also came with a chip that had some kind of lobster dip on it. Yum yum!

This review might be long since I want to do this restaurant justice as well as inform readers about true Greek cuisine and clear any misconceptions.

I shall preface this review by saying that as a Greek I can review this restaurant in a much different (and perhaps more complete) way than many reviewers. Many people associate Greek cuisine with various ""Mediterranean"" and Middle Eastern dishes as well as the usual gyros. 

Greek cuisine however is not limited to ""feta"" and ""gyro"" but actually has a huge variety of dishes and one of its most important ingredients is a jovial and warm atmosphere along with friends to enjoy and celebrate life. 

Estiatorio Milos is located on the 3rd level of the Cosmopolitan resort. The interior has soft hues of grey with wooden accents and Cycladic statues abound: elegant and classy.

The traditional ""menu"" on the table might not seem to be bristling with choices initially but that is because the real menu lies in front of you: all the fresh fish are exhibited in the same way you'd find them in a Greek sea town taverna, along with labels so you can choose which one you want. Your server will be there with you to explain which fish suits you best, some are sweeter, some are more buttery. It is important to notice that the fish are shipped fresh from Greece as are many of the other ingredients.

The staff was astounding. I cannot stress this enough. The fact that our server Yiorgo spoke the language of the Fatherland just added a whole different dimension to the service. Very polite, helpful and warm, like a childhood friend almost, he went above and beyond to ensure we got the best food and offered some amazing recommendations both for food and dessert.

After discussing with Yiorgo a bit in Greek we agreed on the fish choices. Most of the dishes were served ""family style"". That means that you order a whole fish which the server then de-bones and divides in portions for everyone to eat.

We ordered  ""lethrini"" or Pandora/snapper fish and  ""chtapodi"" or octopus-charcoal grilled. The octopus was sweet and perfectly grilled, served with onion. If you have not tasted this amazing animal I highly recommend it. While its unusual appearance might seem alien to some, its taste will surely appeal to everyone! If the chef doesn't know, the octopus will end up having a rubbery texture, but that was not the case and the octopus was juicy and soft, grilled to perfection.

When the lethrini arrived, Yiorgo proceeded to divide it into portions while removing the bones. We hardly found even a tiny fragment of bone on our portions, the sign of a true artist-carver. The fish itself was tender and flavorful, it took me back to childhood memories of eating fresh fish on a taverna by the beach. 

To accompany the fish we also got a very juicy and tender NY steak sliced (for some of our guests who preferred meat-even though they enjoyed fish, trying it for the first time in their life!) along with Greek salad and the Milos Special (thinly sliced zucchini and eggplant friend along with kefalograviera cheese and tzatziki). The Milos Special disappeared within seconds, it was light and fried to perfection and the tzatziki was particularly enjoyable, light on the garlic and refreshing as it should be.

Greek salad traditionally has feta cheese:however in the US most people confuse real feta cheese with the dried up crumbles that are sold as ""feta type"" cheese. 

Nothing could be further from the truth, feta is supposed to be moist and depending on its origin it might be creamy and soft with a mild taste or firm with a sharper taste. The feta used on the Greek salad was true Greek feta, imported from Greece, made from the milk of cows in Epirus. Everyone at our table was a feta connoisseur (only Greeks can claim that title- sorry cheese aficionados) and they all unanimously decreed this feta is excellent.

For dessert we decided to go with the recommendation of our server (who now seemed more like a friend) Yiorgo who suggested we try baklava ice cream. Once again, Yiorgo was spot on, the ice cream was splendid and the baklava was light crispy and not overly sweet.

Overall, Estiatorio Milos is exquisite. One cannot claim to have tasted Greek cuisine in Nevada (and probably many other other states) if they have not been to Milos. Exquisite food, exquisite service, exquisite people.

Tip: If dinner seems too expensive for you (expect to pay at least $60 per person for a sumptuous feast) you can try the lunch time menu which is very reasonably priced (around $20-25 per person).",YRyYbOSwvHkZsZOLv98oQg,5,5/1/2014,1,review,0,Eastside,Lynyrd Skynyrd BBQ and Beer

The fries weren't great, weren't bad. I dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved. They brought out the pizza and I was a little disappointed- it was a bit skimpy on the cheese.

We also had a Jones Street Pizza, it was a good pizza. Nothing to wrote home about. The small was enough for my boyfriend and I. We've had the beer cheese before, it was grainy on my tongue, similar to powder cheese I guess... idk. 

They have an excellent beer selection.  Nice outside patio. And bar access from inside and outside.

Came to this establishment earlier this month for an appropriate occasion...to watch The Bus get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, of course!  Made plans to get together with a couple close friends who were visiting town, catch up, grab food and a few drinks, and watch the highlights of the induction ceremony.  That's exactly what we did and all-in-all ended up spending about 8 hours here.  Time flew by because we were having fun, though the fun was mostly due to the company we were with and not so much to the setting we were in.

I expected the service to be decent but not extraordinary.  It was.

I expected prices to be a little on the high side to account for the prime North Shore location a few steps from Heinz Field.  They were.

I expected the food to be slightly above average at best.  That was the case.

What I didn't expect was for the crowd to be thin until the afternoon Pirates game let out.  Getting there several hours before the ceremony began turned out to be completely unnecessary.  Also didn't expect the food portions to be on just the slightly generous side being that we'd heard from several people that portions here are Bettis-sized.  Husband and I shared a steak salad (half yummy pieces, half chewy pieces) and burger (overcooked) and fries (tasty).

As for drinks, after learning the mimosas came with an inexplicable price tag of $8.25 a piece--when I ordered the server told me she believed the mimosas were ""about $5.50 each""--I opted not to enjoy more than one of those guys.  I also had a couple tasty but weak specialty martinis.

Atmosphere became more fun and lively as the crowd grew in size.  Probably a good option for game day if you want to drink indoors whilst being as close to Heinz Field as possible without actually being in the stadium.

It's rare that I review a restaurant/bar after just one or a couple experiences, but I'm making an exception in this case because, honestly, I don't plan to come back here for quite a while, if ever.

I dropped by here because I felt a little tired of the other asian buffets I visit, and it was in the neighborhood. $6.48 for lunch for one. I walked in and was sat down promptly, but that was about it for service other than plate pick up. Crappy decorations--a staple of low-scale asian buffets--but absolutely no music playing to drown out the coughing, children's cries and random conversation. It felt like I was eating in a run-down restaurant on the side of a highway.
Food was cooked at least.... It's the typical spread you'll see at any other buffet, just not as good. All sauces were watered down to the point that one tasted like all the others. I'd guess that half of the selection of ""hot"" food was previously frozen, and the other half showed that it wasn't made very well. Half of the buffet is made up of soups, the worse of deserts, fruit and a pretty bad ""Mongolian BBQ"" side-bar. I wasn't tempted to try the sushi--though I typically risk it.


Bottom line: If you've been to an asian buffet before, this place will disappoint you. It's one of the worse I've been to, and I see no reason why someone should go here when there's a dozen others that are better in this city.",B19KKE75ZxqoR3EDuvA1qw,2,2/12/2014,1,review,0,Eastside,S7 Buffet

Saw earlier reviews about Grill City when they 1st opened and thought we would give it a few months before trying it out.  Hard to say, but I still feel the pain of many past reviews!

Just the smell of passing by Grill City is intoxicating.  It's smoke, it's dead carcass, it's flames!  All it takes to get your olfactory senses going!  And Grill City is no joke when it comes to grilling!  Their grills are filled to the MAX with all kinds of stuff on skewers!  

So into the line we go.  And boy, is it a line!  Biggest gripe.  They have got to so something about this single line control!  It gets long & tiresome, we had to wait quite a while to be helped.  Seems like only 1 person was taking orders that day so it made the line go real, real slow.  Luckily, the wifey speaks Tagalog so our orders were actually placed quickly once we reached the front of the line.  If you don't speak any Fiiipino like me, be prepared to talk slowly!  For the most part one of the ladies will understand you but just be patient.  And believe me, by the time you get to the front of the line to order, your patience will be thin.

Besides the horrible lining, especially on a busy weekend, especially after Catholic church...the food is some charred goodness!  We ordered from the Grill City 'Value Meals' & 'Value Packs' section of the menu:

*Pork BBQ with naked salad ($6.99)
*Chicken BBQ with naked salad ($6.99)
*Grilled Golden Pompano (2 for $13.00)

Each meal comes with a generous (super generous) portion of steamed white rice, grilled meats came with 'naked' salad which is basically sautéed stir-fry veggies.  You could also get a side of soup or an additional entrée for a bit more money.

Grill City was damn delicious!  Meats had that lovely char on them from a flame, marinated well in that sticky sweet sauce we Filipinos love.  The grilled pompano I was surprised I would like because being a weirdo, I don't really like eating whole fish.  Ai sos!  What kind of sad Filipino am I?  Saying you don't like fish as a Filipino is akin to saying you don't like a da lamb as a Greek.  Damn near sacrilege!  But this grilled pompano was good!  They stuffed it with some tomatoes and lemon pepper seasoning, and when grilled gave it a nice smoky flavor. I rather liked it, especially dipped in suko (vinegar)!  And the white Jasmine rice!  Thankfully Grill City makes it right, need those carbs to cut back on the fatty meat.

Another tiny gripe here is the seating arrangement.  Good luck getting a table on a busy Sunday!  I hope you like sitting next to Filipinos you don't know!  But be friendly anyway.  Most of the tables are seated close together it might as well be communal eating.  I really don't mind, I just smile and go on about my business.  But you private eaters out there beware!  A Filipino old lady be all up in your bizness, asking you if you're single & that she has a niece from the Philippines that is just right for you. 9 out of 10 times - don't believe her.  Ha Ha Ha

Next time we'll probably try and come at a time when it's less busy, likely after a lunch rush but way before dinner.  Maybe the lines will be calmer by then, and the wait much shorter.

Somewhat unfortunately, we came in during an open mic night. The performers weren't awful, but I guess we weren't really in the mood for the loudness.

Anyway, I ordered a pork souvlaki sandwich combo (fries + drink). My total with tax was under $10. The pork was delicious and the sandwich overall was just oozing with flavor (and literally oozing with the sauce). The fries were also perfectly cooked. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.

Make sure you check in to get your free baklava with a purchase of $5 or more. Theirs had the perfect amount of sweetness. I don't like it when baklava has too much of the sauce that makes the dessert way too sweet and sticky.",z0rSmZQz9eEXjg_C3_E5-g,4,11/19/2011,6,review,2,Northwest,Grand Italia

One this occasion I wanted crabs (duh) and muscles. So what did I order? A steampot naturally! This pot contained legs, scallops, muscles, and the standard corn and potatoes.  As is tradition, I asked for a side of Old Bay and a bottle of malt vinegar to create my own paste, which I greedily dunk the meat in. The server, Nicole, was very patient as I requested these things and when I asked for Sweet N Low for my iced tea, I wasn't upset when she explained that they didn't carry it. 

I got a side of hushpuppies to accompany my feast and was not disappointed in the least. I believe I may have converted Darren when he tried one after he told me he didn't like hushpuppies. 

Growing up close to the Chesapeake Bay area, I have perfected the art of picking crabs and managed to get all of the meat out of almost every leg segment in whole. Darren loves watching me at work, never using a fork, and rarely using the nut crackers, or what they call crab crackers. These scallops were the best I have ever had! Seared on only one side and deliciously soft and juicy on the inside. The muscles were also amazing! I was saddened that I didn't have an endless plate of scallops and muscles. I have to say that I did have a pleasant surprise. When I was finished I looked under the plate that was in the pot and noticed an extra scallop and extra muscle! It felt like getting a small bonus!  

I got the chocolate cake for dessert. It was huge! The flavor was ok, but I took home the few bites I couldn't finish and discovered that the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.

It's a shame that they are located a little out of the way from the busier areas because if he didn't know of it, I would have never thought to have checked it out before. In a plaza between West End and Crafton by a Dollar store, pizza places, and Italian subs across the street (don't forget every single fast food restaurant too), this little gem isn't noticeable on the drive at first, but you won't regret it when you walk in.

Like a typical Thai fashion, the place is decorated with draperies, large mirrors, and elephant statues aplenty. However, when we go, it's always pretty empty which kind of makes me sad, as I would like to see the place during its busier hours. On the bright side, this can only mean they can put more focus on our delicious meals.

We usually get the green curry (tofu for me, chicken for him) and it's always the right amount of spiciness. I did try the Thai basil curry before, which was also good and just the spicy I enjoy. You get a fairly large portion for a decent price (no complaints) and I usually have enough leftover for a second meal.

The servers are very polite, yet a little reserved. At least when we have gone, they always sit in the chair at the back to keep their eye on us. It was a polite gesture that I didn't initially understand, haha. Either way, service has always been super.

After 15minutes Carlos, our waiter, came over and took drink orders and asked if he wanted separate checks we said yes if possible but no big deal if it's on 1 check. Carlos looked flustered and walked away, I noticed he walked to the back area which wasn't hidden, and was talking to another server moving his hands and pointing at our table frantically. So Carlos comes back now asked if we were ready. My order was 1/2 dozen of oysters and a salad with shrimp but I asked for no onions or peppers. As I was asking for that my friends Carlos was shaking his head! The next order my friend asked if a oyster list was available and he started shaking his head at her and said no and start rambling off oysters which it was so fast it was incoherent. Now everyone in our group realized he was not excited to be waiting on us. So after we ordered we asked for the manager. One of out friends went to the casino floor and noticed Carlos waiting on another table and he said Carlos seemed like a different person smiling and all.

Now I should add 7 out of 8 of us work in the food service industry 3 out of that 7 are general managers so we know service is important. So we tell the manager how we felt about Carlos' service and it's unacceptable. We also told her about out background in food service and she agreed and wanted to rectify the situation offered discounts which we declined because we aren't free loaders we just wanted to give feedback like we would at our restaurants. So the manager offered grilled oysters which were pretty decent and she said Carlos won't be serving us the rest of our meal. Well 2 minutes later here comes Carlos in a over exaggerated tone asked how is everything? We just stared at him like really dude. But after that we had another server.

We typically just grab some bar seating, there isn't usually a wait for a high top table, and the service is usually on point. The interior is modern and funky, not to mention two levels so there's lots of seating. The location on 4th Street is perfect for people watching, both near the windows and inside the restaurant. The margaritas are tasty and huge and come in fun flavors such as Pomegrita, Prickly Pear, Blackberry Lime, even Mango Avocado. There are lots of frozen margaritas to choose from also. I usually stick with mango, but there's also strawberry, peach, banana, raspberry, coconut, etc. 
I like this place. I've always had a good experience there and the prices are very reasonable. Next time I'm in Cleveland you can be sure I'll be there for some guac and a margarita or two.",knJh7agyWMdPyndI9dURjw,4,6/1/2013,2,review,3,South Summerlin,Red Robin Gourmet Burgers
19239,3,eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,#NAME?,"This was my third time visiting Hash House and the 3rd location I've seen. This particular location was off the strip and the outside looks similar to the one I went to near San Diego. Since there is one directly on the strip in a casino, this location appears to be frequented by more locals instead and less obnoxiously crowded. No need to wait over an hour or so for a table which means we were in and out of there before trekking back to Phoenix in 40 minutes total!

The service was awesome and quick! We especially loved our waitress Izzy! The waiters and waitresses were on top of ""question and answer"" sessions with newcomers. Although there was only my hubs and I at our table, there was a group of 8 next to us with one cranky customer. Despite the customer being unreasonable, their waiter handled the situation with such finesse and ease that it really wasn't such a problem anymore. Whew! Mini crisis averted!

Our food was predictably good. I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with bacon stuffed waffles while Bry ordered the corned beef hash skillet. From the pictures I uploaded, one could tell that these dishes were mighty and grand in stature and had the flavor to match! Anyone who's ""hangry"" can appreciate how this food can quickly cure and almost overwhelm what you thought would be an insatiable hunger.

Servers were very casual in appearance and personality - not what one would expect at a resturant where entres are $40.

The atmosphere was nice.

The presentation of all the food was nice.

We had a cocktail while we were looking over the menu, and they were very tasty, and seemed to be stronger than most restaurants server, which we liked.

The service was good.  They had maybe three or four other tables seated, and a lot of staff on hand.

Now why a rating of 2?
We were not impressed at all with the food.  The pasta my wife ordered was supposed to have rib-eye beef tips.  The two I saw looked like the tips of fat and gristle that you'd cut off a ribeye while you eat the rest.  The pasta was ok and had good flavor, but not too hard to mess up pasta.

I had the sea bass.  I nice little four ounce portion, with bones through half of it.  I mentioned it to the waiter who explained that to find a bone is very rare and lucky.  Well, it was kind of annoying I thought to have to chew it up into baby food consistency, and then wait until my wife turned her head so I could get the bones out of my mouth and hide them, so as not to ruin the dinner.

Don't know if I'm right or wrong, but knowing it's more on the expensive end, I don't mind paying 25 for a piece of fish or some pasta, but it had better blow me away, instead of wishing I'd gone somewhere else.

The complimentary bean dip was ok.  I'm not an afficionado of it or anything, but I could take it or leave it.

Food: it's NOT BBQ!!!!
Ribs- they are not even smoked but I think they boil them first then pour slop sauce over them. They immediately fell off the bone which is a poor indication on cooking process and meat was brown and mushy. 
Rib tips- well that's what they call them which were just little nuggets of super dry meat.
Pulled pork- no flavor and again tasted boiled.
Red beans & rice- only think edible really.
Coleslaw- typical grocery store quality.
Dessert- 6 inch toll house flattened over cooked crap.

The reviews looked good, why not give BSS a try. Baby in tow, I walked over in the heat and called a friend to meet me there. When I walked into BSS, I froze in terror. How is it possible that all of the reviews do not mention that this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned since it opened. Yikes. The floors were a mess, the chair cushions were torn and the staff don't seem to even notice nor do the customers. That may have something to do with the food but more on that later. I was pleasantly greeted by an older woman, Ma Roz I assume. She sent someone in the back to dig out a highchair and specifically asked him to clean it. Well, it came out about half clean with some hairs on it. Nothing wet ones couldn't handle. My friend arrived shorty and she was just as shocked as I was. Well, I was committed at this point so we were going to give it a try. We both decided on breakfast. I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. There are some interesting pancake mix ins to note such as marshmallow, thin mints and chocolate chip cookies. I decided to go with peaches and blueberries. It didn't take long for our food to arrive. My pancakes looked incredible though they were missing one thing, whipped cream. Not a problem, they easily remedied that situation. I took my first bite and ta da! The light bulb went on. I suddenly understood why locals would keep coming back to this place despite the decor- if you want to call it that. They quite possibly could have been the best pancakes I have ever eaten. The fruit was fresh. That's right, FRESH peaches. Not canned stuff like you might assume for a small establishment such as this. The bacon was also cooked to perfection. They definitely know how to do it right here. And the prices were very reasonable. $4.50 for 3 pancakes, or should I say heaven cakes, and only $.50 a mix in.  I think they may only accept cash here so, you may want to head to the ATM first. Although, I was shocked and quite honestly, taken aback by the decor of BSS, I was also blown away by the quality of the food. If they sunk a little money into cleaning, fixing the uneven floor and replacing the chair cushions this place would be top notch and easily deserve 5 stars.",k7VQD0pbdFN0Ju0yNVrtZQ,3,7/17/2013,0,review,0,Southeast,Teppan Bento

The place is rather unassuming from the outside. We arrived at around 6:30, and I would say around 40% full. The wait staff is very friendly. The first thing that grabbed my eye, was their wine list. The prices are very competitve! We had a nice bottle of pinot for $38! I saw an Italian wine on the menu that I paid $130 2 weeeks ago, and it was going for $75. On to the food,,, the menu was quite good and the thing that impresses is that all the food is organic and humane. Big plus! I had a chicken dish that was very tasty. My wife had a tender loin with a jalepeno sauce that was just right and not overpowering. I enjoyed our dining experience and would return definetely! A couple of things,,, lights are a little bright for dinner and they need some type of background music. The atmosphere was some what generic.

Queso Good allows you to eat this on the go, but be forewarned...it gets messy! There are about 10 varieties to choose from, but know they all have one thing in common. They're HUGE. This could be two separate meals, but anything is single-serving if you're hungry enough! ;-)

I opted for the ""pork-a-dilla"", stuffed with guacamole, roasted pork, a touch of sour cream, and chorizo. While the tortilla was much too buttery for me, I immediately gorged on the gigantic meal, with the messy contents spilling out into my little basket. Fortunately, they give you a side of tortilla chips to scoop up every bit of goodness. Be sure to pour some of their tasty green salsa over that.

Some say ""you are what you eat"", and I definitely felt like a pig after this meal. I'm not proud of myself--it was probably like a million calories.

A couple weeks ago while walking around Lawrenceville waiting for seats at Coca's, my friend and I passed by this Dozen's and were surprised to see that they served brunch!

Today we finally made the trip to Dozen Bake Shop to try out their brunch.  I got their quiche of the day, which was made with green beans and came with a side of roasted potatoes.  She got their pumpkin french toast.  In the spirit of October, we both also got hot apple cider since it's getting chilly outside and it's such a seasonal drink.

The quiche was absolutely delicious.  I've never had quiche with green beans before, but it was a pleasant change.  The potatoes were pretty standard.  The french toast was super dense and hearty and rich; the pumpkin flavor was subtle and worked to enhance rather than overpower the entire dish.

I really like all the baked goods and pies they have on display too, they look so good..........  We thought of getting a pastry to split if the food wasn't enough but we had trouble finishing our own dishes already =/  Oh well, they'll be good for brunch another Sunday!

Although it's small, it's worth feeling cramped. The food is out of this world and you can tell they use fresh local food with good ingredients. E2 is also BYOB so if you want a mimosa with your brunch you bring your favorite champagne and they provide the OJ.

The place is fairly small, but it has a pretty good take out customer traffic; so getting a table wasn't a problem, but to figure out what to eat was the difficult, because of too many choices.     I ended up with a combo teri beef, and Garlic Chicken.

They took about ten minute to set up the plate, and my teri beef was okay....nothing to write home about, but the Chicken was kind of a stolen recipe of L & L (the ones in Hawaii) garlic chicken...it was good!   but the Mac salad sucked a#s, and they need to work on that big time.

My Chinese friend said its the only place in town she's found that serves the fungus - interesting, they're chewy and look like mini versions of the natural sponges you use as wash cloths. 

Food is cheap I think both dishes were $8 each and you get free soup and dessert so it's a 3 course meal for $8 if you eat in. The free soup wasn't just pork bones and cabbage like other Chinese places - it had big pieces of pork, lotus root and carrots. My friend called it MSG water, but whatever it was free, so no complaints here. Dessert was a warm tapioca soup - tasted like there was bean paste in it too.

The lunch that I have gotten the past three times or so has been over salty and sometimes just not as good. Their dinner however and their chef specialties is what would make me come back time and time again. Their specialties are super difficult to find anywhere else in Arizona, especially for the price that they sell it at, so I would definitely suggest it.

Serving breakfast and lunch only, they are open from 7 AM to 3 PM.  When you enter, you walk to the center register area and place your order.  You're given a card to place on a holder on your table.  When your food is ready, it's delivered to your table.

I ordered the guava chiffon pancakes with a coffee.  The coffee was brought almost as soon as I sat down and I was given a chip with the explanation that it was good for one refill.  I was told at the register that there was one refill on coffee.

There are a number of pancakes and Hawaiian dishes on the menu and the aloha spirit is evident in the decorations of the area.  This was the former home of Parma by Chef Marc and there are two good sized rooms.

In a short time, my short stack of guava chiffon cakes arrived.  Two cakes at a price of $7.75.  The coffee is $3.25 and I used my chip for a refill.

The guava chiffon is sweet and unless you like guava, I wouldn't recommend them to you.  The pancakes were fluffy and cooked just right.  You are given plastic ware and the food is served on a heavy paper plate with sloped sides.

I liked the cakes but I probably would choose something else another time.  Two friends showed up right after I started to eat and I really had my eye on the one person's order of a half portion of a benedict that looked quite good.

This experience was just not great from the moment we pulled into the parking lot. I didn't want to valet my car because the parking lot was right there, but I had to wait for someone to tell me where to park and they made me park way in the back, which I thought was pretty inconvenient. So you either have to valet even though it's unnecessary or park at the back of the lot. ok whatever. We get in and check in with the host, she tells my boyfriend happy birthday and asks us to go wait for a bit. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I figured they were just setting the table up real quick. 10 min goes by and we get seated by the entrance, which wasn't the best place since everyone passes by there. There is a ""team"" that serves you rather than just one person so we had 4 people filling up our waters as soon after we would take a drink and everyone kept asking how things were going. it got pretty annoying. We ordered the fried calamari and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. the calamari wasn't anything fancy, it wasn't seasoned with anything and the sauce is regular tarter sauce, so we were pretty disappointed. (if you want crazy good calamari, you need to go try capital grill). The scallops were a good size and it was really good, but we've definitely had better. the scallops were on the dry side but tasted pretty good. for the entrees, I ordered their special surf and turf with a 6oz filet and lobster and my bf ordered their 14oz prime rib oscar style. 40 min passes and the food finally comes out, I cut into my steak and it's perfect medium rare and everything was very tasty. my boyfriend did not get his steak Oscar style as ordered so we had to have them take it back while we waited. Ribeye steaks are suppose to be really juicy and tender but his steak was tough and chewy and definitely not what we expected from a nice steakhouse. We really don't like to complain so he just ate it. They forgot my boyfriend's bday and never brought out his dessert so I had to ask and that's when one of the servers remembered. The server Colette was really the savior of the night and the only one that really made any sense there. the manager came by and asked how everything was going and apologized for all the hiccups throughout the night and said dessert was on him. they brought out an Oreo chocolate ice cream cake slice for the oops remedy and a creme brûlée with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday treat. there were a lot of other weird interactions throughout the night that I don't want to take the time to type out but I've had way better service and food at other places and probably won't be coming back here.",7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw,3,9/29/2013,0,review,0,Downtown,Tacos Estephanie

La Piazza is located in the unlikely location of a Best Western Hotel. I have not ventured past the pizza here, so no opinion on the rest of the menu. Vegas, the other windy city where most of the pizza blows, offers La Piazza, where you will discover an outstanding thin crust pie....not New York Style. I'm really not sure what kind of pizza category it would fall under. The crust is thin, and crisp, and can handle a kitchen full of toppings without going limp. They also offer up a Chicago style deep dish pie that is also pretty rockin'. I'm not saying it's the best by Chicago standards, but you would be hard pressed to find a better Chicago style deep dish pizza here in Vegas. Rosati's being up there for the Chicago style too. My biggest problem with the place is trying to decide on the thin crust or the deep dish. Staff is friendly, place is clean, the neighborhood will be a turn off for those that have been coddled in life, but it's not THAT bad really from a safety standpoint. To walk there from Fremont and Main St. Is really no problem, it's not a scenic stroll though. If you're looking for a scene or to be seen, this is not the place for you.

And another menu was like a test paper. 

On a beautiful afternoon, hang outside as you get a beautiful view of downtown Summerlin's plaza.  As for me, I had the pleasure to try a pre-birthday brunch here! A pal of mine was kind enough to take me here because it was a rather interesting venue. 

Chicken sausage & cheddar grits 5/5: it's a whole lot of different flavors combined to one. And if you ask me, it's a really creative way to put an entree together. It truly represents what brunch is supposed to be with an incorporation of breakfast items tasting like lunch! So this entree comes with  
two fried eggs, blistered tomatoes, grilled corn, bacon, greens, and beer-blanc sauce. I can't begin to describe my favorite part of each element. I think if you were to take one apart the whole dish would fall apart. Great execution and a must try. 

Setting: whether you're eating inside or out, it's a beautiful ambiance overall. Inside feels like a revamped take of a classroom with school-themed decors like books, globes, and rulers. It sounds a bit off-putting but it's really just the decors that sets them apart. Other than that, it looks like a modern restaurant with beautiful lighting and spacious dining experience. 

Service: nothing special about the service. Our server seemed to take on her routine taking care of one customer to the other without tailoring anything special. At one point we got a bit antsy because we were finished with our meal and she hasn't stopped by in a while. I suggested to pay at the hostess' booth if she didn't arrive any time soon.

I don't know what's going on there, the lady who answers the phone has absolutely no idea what's she's doing. The first time it took us 3 times for her to take our order because she kept putts us on hold and forgetting, and then an hour and a half goes by and still no food so we call again and she has no recollection of our order or anything so we told her to forget it. Tonight we decided to give it one more try and ordered through the app through Yelp, which I've done many time before with them, and the expected wait time for delivery was 45-60mins. So when an hour goes by I call to see how much longer our food will be, scared that what happened the first time is going to happy again, and got the same lady who had no idea we even ordered through the app or that there had been an ordered placed at all. She has absolutely no clue what's she's doing. It used to take 10 mins to order food from here because they remembered our phone number and address we order that much.

And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this. 

The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already. 

Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah.

I treated my mother out to a coffee and some sweets because I'm a good son (jk). I ordered the #3 gallete (sp?) had asked if I could get it with any other cheese because I really don't like goat cheese after the cashier ran back 3 times to ask the chef he allowed it and it was literally amazing. There's something about gruyere and not many places using it that really makes it so good when you get it, 

My mother ordered a macchiato and to her dismay she received a real macchiato and not what Starbucks brands as a sugary death trap. She was a little upset until I explained to her it was correct and she should have asked if it was American style. But she really enjoyed the flavor and just wished there was more beverage. I told her next time to get a cappuccino dry. She also got the ham and cheese croissant and it made up for all the issues with her drink. 

The only cons I noticed were the tables being kind of on top of each other so if it was actually packed you would have no privacy.  The other major con was they have no real cups that we saw. I hate drinking out of paper and plastic if I'm staying. It's not classy and it's actually cheaper to rewash cups. 

All in all I have my eyes on that tiramisu.   Someone tell me if it's as good as it looks. 

Update: the blueberry muffin looked a lot better than it tasted. It was too mushy on the inside and the blueberries were too sour. It's like they didn't get good ones.

First, the aquarium separating the bar area and the main dining area is pretty neat, and is especially peaceful if you're not a seafood eater.  The atmosphere is nice, and we probably just went at an off time, yet, we went during off lunch hours, so the service should have been better.
Our server greeted our table, took our drink order, took our food order, and was not to be seen again... well, we saw her waiting the other tables but purposely avoiding ours.  That continued for 35 minutes while other tables with larger groups who were seated after us were served before us... 35 minutes for three bowls of soup, a garden salad (which never came) and a couple pieces of fried fish?  I think not.  We flagged down a manager who said he was finishing it right up.  And then when the food came out, it was cold.  We mentioned it to her and she seemed frustrated that she needed to make another trip to the line to have it reheated.  Give me a break. 
I also ordered a chicken quesadilla.  On the menu it stated ""stuffed with pico.  Served with (some sort of ) sour cream"".  It came out and was *SURPRISE* drizzled with some sort of chipotle and cilantro mayonnaise-based topping.  Maybe its because I live in the land of full disclosure, I'm not sure, but I was expecting tortilla, chicken, cheese, pico and sour cream on the side, not to have some calorie-laden ranch-dressing-derivative covering the tortilla.
So for the last ten minutes of our meal (and the first five) the service was very attentive.  If you like that, eat here.  If you like having service at a restaurant, and warm seafood, go to Red Lobster instead.
On the way out, I saw a TON of food under heat lamps on their line, and some of it coming out of steamtables... absolutely NO excuse for cold, cream-based soup... and no excuse for that small of an order taking 35 minutes.

When I mentioned that we was going back to Charlotte my boyfriends eyes lit up and he was supper excited to eat Nana's again Cafeteria style soul food. I've had the meatloaf.. It was Yummy. Their pork chops are to die for!! And you can't go wrong with their fried chicken!! My boyfriend love the smothered chicken breasts!! What's crazy is that for it to be cafeteria style the food still has the fresh out the oven taste and and supper tender! Mac and cheese is delicious!! Cabbage isn't mushy. The cornbread muffin is okay nothing to brag about.. It's actually on the dried side!! Yams are good too!! The potato salad was to salty.. Then again I'm very picky with potato salad.

When I stepped inside with our party, we were all surprised with a greeting from busy wait staff... And a giant conveyor belt whisking sushi all around the restaurant! This conveyor belt drew us in.

 And then, the conveyor belt delivered our meals. I tried the Las Vegas Roll (naturally), the Sexy Roll, and the Spicy Seafood Roll. The Vegas Roll was my favorite of the three, because it represents my adopted hometown and somehow barbequed eel, masago, & cream cheese make for a great menage a trois. The Sexy Roll was also quite good, as the eel sauce managed to make tempura shrimp even better than it otherwise is alone. 

The Spicy Seafood Roll was OK, but IMHO nothing to write home about. Other than that, I was plesantly surprised by this joint... Especially when considering how affordable it is!

I weigh my food, count my calories and watch my macros so having the flexibility to build my meal in advance to meet those requirements was an absolutely amazing feature! This way you are 100% in charge of your nutrition and can eat as good, or as bad, as you wish. This, in my opinion, is a game changer!

Great idea Chipotle! You just earned yourself a fan.

I was right, one anorexic wing and a piece of chicken breast.  I ask the lady behind the counter if they had a wing with more meat since all I get are bones each and every time.

It has been an uphill battle to find good delivery Chinese food in Spring Valley/Summerlin.  Everything I""ve tried has been disappointing until last night.  Chow Mein Express is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Here is what we ordered:

Pork w/ string beans in spicy garlic - Very delicious sauce makes this spicy dish good, but the pork was fatty and chewy.  The string beans remained crisp in the sauce, which saved the dish.

Fried Chicken Wings - Fantastic!  Not too greasy, prepared with chili oil, diced jalapenos, scallions, and garlic.  This was the best thing we ordered.  It was more salty than spicy.

Sweet n' Sour Chicken - High quality white meat chicken made these little fried morsels pretty enjoyable.  The sauce was a bit bland, so I just dipped in Sriraucha sauce (Thai chili sauce w/ the rooster on the bottle) which helped a lot.

Veggie fried rice - Bland, with chunks of vegetables that would have been better cut smaller.  Not worth ordering really.

Overall this place is nothing special, but for a delivery Chinese meal it is pretty good, and worth the 40 minutes you may wait.",KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw,3,11/19/2010,1,review,1,Other,Cathay House

I visited for the lunch buffet.  It was affordably priced and everything was very tasty.  I enjoyed that everything was clearly labeled so you know what you are eating.  There are three sections to the buffet.  The hot section that has all your entree choices, rice and naan.  The cold secion that had salads and sauces and the dessert section that featured a few choices, most notably rice pudding.

Even though it was a buffet, everything tasted fresh.  

Service and atmosphere are the reasons I didn't give this five stars.  They were busy, but the server had a bit of an attitude.  She seemed a bit put off by the fact that I wanted a refill on my water.  The layout is also strange.  There is a large front room, a hallway, another dining room and the back room with the buffet.  I was seated in the hallway area and it was kind of awkward with so many people walking past.

The usual bartender Will wasn't here but we sat down anyways. 5 minutes later after watching the bartender hit on this poor girl he finally came over to us. He approached us as if we were a burden, an inconvenience to him. He put two cocktail menus in front of us and the happy hour specials. I asked him if they still had the champagne happy hour for girls he rolled his eyes shook his head, laughed and walked away. My boyfriend called out he wanted a Guinness. 13 minutes later (yes I timed it) my boyfriend was finished w his beer and I still wasn't able to order my cocktail. I told him to make me his favorite specialty cocktail that was on the happy hour list. He made me what's called a ""naked lunch"" 1oz of sake, aperol, vodka, line juice and coke. When I saw him pouring all the alcohol I turned to my boyfriend laughed and said ""well I guess your getting lucky tonight!"" The bartender looked at me and said, ""this isn't all booze it's not that strong"" handed me the cocktail and asked if we were going to eat we said no but thank you. His reply ""well we have tables available, our dining room is gorgeous."" That was my cue he really didn't want us sitting at his bar. We asked for the check and realized he didn't charge is the happy hour price for my cocktail, when I asked about this he laughed and walked away. I paid full price (not a huge deal but it's the principle of the matter) and we left. He yelled out after us that we had change.

People always ask me that same question every time I drag them alllll the way out to Blue Diamond just for the Crisp Rolled Burritos when there's a Taco Bell just down the street from me.

The grub at this spot really is THAT good though (for deep-fried fast food)  Their 1/4lb crisp tacos are just way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco in my opinion, but my true favorites are the rolled crisp chicken burritos.   Imagine chicken in Alfredo sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep fried until the tortilla is crispy and flaky, but the chicken is not all dried out (Mind you, it's not really Alfredo Sauce, I think, but it's just what the sauce reminds me of).  It's really hard to explain but it's just such good grub!

21202,3,rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,iDOHJAExc7KZW6epdCib3A,"The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.

We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  

When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.

After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  

Appetizers: 
* Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!
* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!
* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!
* Edamame
* Garlic Chicken
* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)
* Pork Gyoza
* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)
* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)

Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.
* Albacore
* Amaebi (limit one order per person)
* Garlic Tuna
* Hamachi 
* Hirame
* Ika
* Ikura
* Saba
* Sake
* Scallop Mayo
* Tai
* Uni (limit one order per person)

Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.

Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.

I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.

They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   

You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.

Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.

They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.

What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to ""delicious but"" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the ""in season"" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.",TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,2,2/20/2013,27,review,21,Southeast,Giorgio Ristorante E Caffe

The staff was super friendly, I was greeted right away and given plenty of suggestions and ideas on what to try. I ended up going with a red velvet cupcake.

We ordered an appetizer, loaded nachos or something, and it was literally a handful of nachos with microwaved cheese on the top, and sprinkled with shredded lettuce and a tablespoon of salsa. On the side was an ounce of sour cream and jalapenos. It looked disgusting. We ate 1-2 nachos and ordered the ""sampler tray appetizer"" hoping it would be better. It was not. The manager accused us of eating all of the nachos before sending them back and still charged us for ""half of the nachos"". The only upside of this place was the secluded back room specifically for those who wanted to watch the world series. Food was horrible, service was ""ok"", management was horrible. Just Horrible. This bar needs John Taffer from Bar Rescue immediately. They are also RACIST.! Is it ironic that the only 2 African American groups in the bar that night had an unsatisfactory experience. A separate and unrelated couple had a similar experience to us as far as how we were treated that night (We spoke outside the building while leaving). I was also told by a random employee that I could not wear my hoodie (black nike hoodie with big red NIKE word across the front) inside the building. Others at the table beside us even debated that this wasn't true because they are frequent goers of the establishment and never had that issue themselves. Our waiter also kept standing near our table for about 20 minutes after we received the tab; as if she was monitoring us to make sure we do not leave without paying (keep in mind that we came to watch the world series which had an hour left in the game).

What a cool place in the middle of who knows where. My friend showed me this great place, claiming it was one of the best of Cleveland's dining. And he was right.

We went during happy hour and sat at the bar. It's a cozy bar/restaurant, one where you'll find locals hanging out at. They have quite the selection of brews (I learned there was an Ohio Brewing Company? Never knew that before...), and the appetizers were cheap during happy hour....and GOOD.

We ordered the mussels, the stuffed peppers, and the crabcakes. OMG, the mussels were great! They were big, fresh, and super super tasty. All for $5. The plate was huge for that price...and the mussels were really tasty. The stuffed peppers were good as well- they were banana peppers stuffed with some type of sausage/chorizo mixture...definitely was on the spicy side but good as well. The crabcake was a good amount....I think I've had better crabcakes elsewhere, but it was still overall, pretty good.

My fiancé and I come here regularly for the happy hour and to grab a bite to eat.  We have tried almost every dish on the happy hour menu, except for the two seafood selections, and have enjoyed them all.  The duck burger sliders are delicious and well seasoned.  The grilled flatbread with arugula pesto and a fried egg is very good, too.  Our favorite happy hour dish is the spicy soba noodles.  They're extremely spicy and go well with an IPA.  They also make excellent burgers, fries, pasta, and a variety of other dishes.  After your meal you have to try the tiramisu.  It is possibly the best tiramisu I have tasted in my life.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered from either the happy hour or regular menu.

The beer, wine, and booze selection is a dream.  They have a rotating selection of good beers on tap.  The variety often includes at least one IPA, a dark beer, and some sort of barleywine or strong beer.  The Grovewood has a nice range of booze and they make an excellent margarita.

The staff are friendly and attentive.  Once you have been in the Grovewood a few times they will know your name, where you like to sit, and what you like to drink.  The friendly staff and owners are knowledgable about the food, wine, and beer.  I think the staff may be the best part about the Grovewood, if not a close second behind the tiramisu.

Street parking is easy in the area for people who are coming from across town.

Also, I can't help but noticing when reading other people's reviews how much the word ghetto comes up.  If you think the Grovewood is ghetto then you better drive back out to the suburb you came in from.

Everything is described to you by friendly servers with where things come from.  Very impressive.  Especially for a hotel restaurant!  I think a lot of people have a common misconception that all hotel restaurants must be a chain of some sort.  It's nice that the Renaissance welcomes them in. 

The outer part of Braddock's is just a bar area or ""Braddock's Streetside.""  The back part of Braddock's is a fancy dining room.  It's really quite gorgeous inside.  I couldn't pass up a tasty looking beet salad so I ordered one up.  It's a beautiful presentation with two unassuming fried goat cheese balls.  But holy crap were those some amazing balls!!  The beets were good, don't get me wrong... and I liked shallot vinaigrette, but those cheese balls... star of the show!  

I'd come back just for a plate full of those, even though I know it wouldn't be the healthiest option!  I definitely want to come back for dinner and get some of the other delicious sounding items and perhaps a cocktail.  It would be a nice date night spot.

We asked for suggestions based on several that we liked and enjoyed and were offered three similar choices.  Our selection was excellent.  Our food was also very good.  I had swordfish, the feature of the night, served on a bed of chickpeas and a grain I can't remember with a Asian calamari topping that was excellent.  My wife had the Grouper which was cooked to perfection and sat on a bed of lentils and arugula.  The arugula was a bit tough and stringy but otherwise the dish was good.

Our server also had to step in as bartender. She was apologetic when she infrequently came to check on us.  She offered my wife another glass of wine 'on the house' and said our appetizer would be comped. When the check came she said they took 25% off the bill.  Frankly, the original offer was a better deal. We didn't ask for a discount but felt it was deserved.  To their defense, the food was good however Grilled Salmon Salad was super small for $17.  Ugh!

On your first two visits be sure to try the green chili pork and the beef meats in either the burrito or tacos. Both have exceptional flavor.  Burritos are massive, along the scale of Chipotle restaurants. The chips and salsa are nice and light even though you will get a generous portion.

The bar itself is a typical dive bar.  Dark and full of beer signs and tv's.  The a/c could use a little work.  It was definitely a little warm inside.  I ordered the bbq pork sliders.  They came out quite fast and tasted great.  Very soft slider buns and the pork was very juicy. 

The karaoke was a little different of a story.  The host seemed very nice but her rotation style is a little out of whack.  I put all my songs in at 9pm when it started and by 1230am I had sang one solo and once with a friend on a duet.  The regulars who are buddy buddy with the host all seemed to sing multiple times and much sooner than myself.

- Beautiful architecture. The main room is very loud but if you sit in the front part of the former vestibule, it's much more pleasant.
- Good sangria.
- Friendly server.
- Tacos are good, the lamb was my favorite.

Cons:
- Expensive. I like America's Tacos just as much (and their corn is better) and my bill will be far less. Granted, not the same atmosphere, but come on, did Phoenix really need another place to get tacos? 
- Service was iffy. Our party of five was willing to overlook given the business is new, despite this being a concept restaurant from an established restaurant chain that one would presume has its act together. But the food did not come at the same time, served one plate at a time with about 5+ minutes wait  in between. Only the first person served (who politely waited and ate his food cold) got exactly what they ordered. Only I got my dinner delivered from our server. The rest was brought by mystery staff who weren't all that friendly.
- The charge for the bill was wrong. Our server blithely told us to pay however we wanted, so one of our party paid for two people and the entire tip. Two of us discovered the next day that the restaurant had charged each card 20% extra, effectively changing the amount from the signed slips.

There's been an explosion of different burger franchises in the last few years to challenge the leaders.  But I think SmashBurger has a way to go.

I was less than impressed by the [lack of] atmosphere.  I could be a fan of minimalist design, but I found the grey upper walls and khaki lower ones just depressing.  The counter where you order your food looks like they forgot to build the other half.  But they say you can't eat the atmosphere, so on to the food.

My husband and I both ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger, but I substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Swiss.  The burger was cooked medium-well, but was still juicy and didn't suffer from what I usually complain about - too much salt.  But there must have been such a tiny bit of the cheese, since I didn't get even the slightest kick from it.  The egg bun tastes very good, but isn't firm enough to hold up under the liquid from the burger, pickles, tomatoes, and grilled onions.  My husband ordered the sweet potato fries, which I'm not crazy about, so I just had the burger.  To me, they looked almost burnt, but he loves burnt food, so it was okay by him.  

Because I had just the burger, I left feeling as if I'd had an appetizer, not dinner.  I wish they offered a side salad, or something besides more fried stuff.  But they don't.  Makes me appreciate Chipotle even more.  Now that's a meal, even though it's not a burger.",uGcC3CKAolcwfOTMjjoexQ,2,12/14/2010,1,review,1,Other,Hash House A Go Go

We came here for the sunday brunch at 3pm, and they switched over to dinner menu at 4pm, woot woot for double selection.  Good quality food for a reasonable $25, +5 for unlimited champagne.  The selection is not quite as big as the Wynn, but for the price difference I'd say the Bellagio has the better deal.  
  To start out you have the choice of about 5 or 6 different cooked fish items, grilled swordfish, grilled bluenose, roasted bluenose, salmon, seared halibut, grilled chilean sea bass cooked 2 different ways.  The cooked fishes items combined with the Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab legs and dinner sushi options destroy the Wynn's seafood selection.  Of course there is prime rib, but what buffet doesn't have prime rib, come on, your crappy Reno buffet has it.

It tasted great, was creamy, and a little kick to it.  It was very hot which was very welcome since it was like 10° outside.  Next I ate the sandwich, which uses a flat bread.  It was very tasty. I especially liked the crunchiness of the edges of the flatbread.

Not being frrom Vegas I called to make sure that they would be open and for the location. Since they were really close to closing I decided to call for 2 Cebiche Mixtos'. The only thing I was disappointed as far as Cebiche was that they did not offer spice. I am not an expert in Peruvian food but I do know my Peruvian food. 

Well, the waitress was really nice and allowed my group of 4 people to dine-in while she finish cleaning up, which I really appreciated! =]

What I order:

-Cebiche Misto: Really good (8/10)
-Jalea: Eh (5/10- I do hate Jalea, I order it in accident, was drunk)
- Chicha Morada: GREAT! It was really, really good, and the price for the pitcher was unbelievable (10/10)",4VXIS8vpNzEysXZVN5xGDA,4,8/25/2012,0,review,0,Other,Oyster Bar

Crab-stuffed Mushrooms were quite cheesy, just as I had hoped.  The best Pasta Fagioli is served here: hot assortment of beans with Ditalini Pasta swimming in a thick and robust tomato-based broth topped by grated cheese.  Endless Garden Salad with the OG's homemade light Green Goddess Dressing, lettuce, tomato slices, pepperoncini, and seasoned croutons sufficed as another great prelude to my entree of Spaghetti with Meatballs & Sausage in Bolognese Meat Sauce, also topped by grated Parmesan Cheese.  I opted for 2 meatballs and 1 sausage link, and had plenty of food, even though a normal add on is 2 lengths of the mild Italian Sausage.  Zeppoles were sugar-dusted and good as well, nicely dippable in a Chocolate Sauce.  Tiramisu and other desserts also looked fetching, but I left them to others.

Alas, the vaunted buttered Breadsticks were good but not great.  I prefer them to be lighter.
Still 4-1/2 stars overall in what seemed like a fine Italian meal one would be much likelier to be served in a non-chain restaurant.

In fact, so much scotch that it's a known destination for scotch ... scotch, scotch, down to my belly ... tastings. 

Anyway, Piper's is great, doesn't matter when you go to eat - the menu offers similar selections for lunch and dinner. It's a vegetarian/pescatarian paradise - I go for the Ploughman's Platter (or Ploughman's wrap, same goodies just all rolled up), the Salmon Platter (good for sharing) and the soups have all been delicious. Seeing the entrees come out is enough to make my mouth water, even if it is a beefy-beefed up Shephard's Pie. Portions are pretty big on everything I've had; enough for a meal+ in most cases. 

And I usually steer away from describing scene, but it doesn't feel like South Side really (this is most times a good thing); even being nestled so discretely in between our neighborhood Burger King and Primanti's.

First, the lines are ridiculously long and the bouncers are incredibly rude. We've done it all - come early, get on a guest list, bribe - and each time we get a new bad experience with the bouncers. One incident, we were early in line, on the guest list and even spoke with the manager. I was wearing a button down short sleeve shirt and dress shoes. The bouncers let us wait in line for an hour, then when we were finally getting in, he took me out of line and said I wasn't up to code. My really good friend asked to speak to the manager, and they eventually let us in, but that was absurd. When I actually went inside, I was better dressed than half the people there!

Second, the bouncers are tricky when you get in inside. When they think you are drunk, they pretend they will give you water or give you air. Little do you know that they are actually escorting you out of the club. I definitely understand that there is a liability, but they separate you from your group and we lost a couple of people and never realized it until hours later. On top of that, I had one friend who definitely drank too much, and I was there to pick her up, but they would not allow me to. They sent her in an ambulance, and when I got to the hospital, the doctors said she wasn't even that drunk. Apparently the security at Tao are doctors and can judge when a friend can go on their own. 

Finally, the drinks are ridiculously priced, the place is way too crowded and the pictures of the Dalai Lama in on the walls are just absurd.

I'm normally a savory girl but the sweets totally won my heart this time around.  My boyfriend fell in love with their bread pudding and went back for seconds and thirds.  

We came back the next morning for breakfast.  Although the selection was changed they had awesome pancakes, and french toast.  I also had way too many pieces of bacon and over did the whole scrambled eggs too.  Next time we're definitely coming back for their breakfast buffet with bottomless mimosas!",ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw,4,1/23/2013,0,review,0,Southwest,WTPho

I went with some girlfriends for Happy Hour,  I got there just at the tail end of the HH, so I ordered some of the HH food while I waiting for my friends to arrive.  I ordered the bruschetta, only the last 4 on the list are part of the deal, so I ordered one of each.  Also the Ortagio plate is 1/2 off during HH, so we had that too.  It is a lot a vegetable for the amount of hummus you get.  For the price is not bad.  The bruschetta were good but nothing special.  My favorite were the first two, the one with gorgonzola and sweet fruit and the one with the olive tapenade.  Now the wine list by the glass is really short.  My friends and I decided to try the tasting card.  This is where we had some hiccups.  I thought the idea was fabulous.  I started with my first pour, we opted to get the minimum pour, so we could taste more.  First one was without any issues.  The second one, the server suggested I hit the half pour and that I will be charged only the amount it pours, because it had enough for the 1 1/2 oz pour, but not for the 1/2 glass.  When I hit the button, I got less than the 1 1/2 oz pour.  I called the server immediately, and had him compared the amount to the one my girlfriend had gotten (she got the 1 1/2 pour of another wine), mine was 2/3 of hers and I was being charged a lot more.  I told him I wouldn't mind paying almost $8 had I gotten the amount they claimed I was served.  The manager came over and she offered a $5 credit.  My third taste the same thing happened and I was done with the tasting choice.  I ordered a glass of wine from the wine list.  Then one of my girlfriends tried to get another tasting and the same thing happened to her.  She did get a credit also, but it is a little annoying to have to call the manager and start comparing pours.

49816,7,135DbbQnr3BEkQbBzZ9T1A,bBuODkhJ1zcNcYYr0rEO-w,"I visited last night with a friend for dinner at around 6pm.  I received a pack of City Dining Cards for Christmas, and she picked this place from among the options that I offered, since she'd heard good things about it.  I was also interested in trying it out, given the speakeasy ambiance and the interesting-looking Cajun menu options.

Having previewed the menu ahead of time, I decided to get the Cajun shrimp and grits, since this is a classic Cajun dish, and I haven't had it previously.  It came with 5 shrimp (see photo) seasoned with Cajun seasonings that gave them a nice spicy kick.  The majority of this entree was vegetables and grits.  Aside from the spices on the shrimp, the word I'd use to describe this dish is ""inoffensive.""  While nothing was wrong with it, per se, it just wasn't very exciting--in this respect, it was similar to something you'd see at Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday.  For a $19 entree at a place billing itself as a gastropub, I expect more pizzazz--and more shrimp!

I didn't try my friend's po' boy because I had a (very good) shrimp po' boy the day before for lunch.  She enjoyed it, this being the first time she'd had a po' boy.  It was $13, which I felt was also on the pricy side, esp. for a sandwich. It came with a side of house made chips, which I sampled, that I felt were a bit overdone.  In addition to our food, we each had a drink (hard cider for me, beer for her).  Both our drinks ran $6, which I felt was also on the expensive side, but hers was discounted to $4, which I felt was more typical.

The one thing that really shined about our experience was our waiter's personality.  He was humorous and interactive in a good way, which is always a nice, unexpected bonus.  We were seated in the booth section on the ground floor next to the bar, and I found the ambiance overall to be pretty bland, reminiscent of a chain casual dining restaurant.  I later found out that the speakeasy, where the live music is hosted, is downstairs, so perhaps this has a better ambiance.  I'd be willing to return at some point just for drinks to check it out.

Overall, while I have no real complaints about our experience except the inflated prices, nothing really stood out about it, aside from our waiter's personality. In a city with as many great dining options as PGH, restaurants really need to stand out to do a good business.  If the sparsely populated dining room and bar that we encountered at prime time on a Sat. evening is par for the course, this is evidence that the locals recognize this place's shortcomings in this regard.  3.5 stars.

P.S. Shrimp and grits are available for half the price nearby at Carmi on Western Ave.  I haven't tried them there, but if the fried chicken I had there is any indication, I'll be willing to bet that they're good!",74gDxr6rs_8tUTcS1vkr0Q,3,1/4/2015,13,review,10,The Strip,Bonnano's

Months before the trip, I had been researching and reading tons of reviews on different restaurants and bars. I know I wanted to do at least one buffet, and for the most part, the internets told me to go to the Bellagio Buffet. 

Me and my boyfriend went on a Saturday night, and it was pretty disappointing. 

First, we had to wait about twenty minutes. It's not a long wait, but when we finally were seated, we passed probably abut 20 empty tables. I'm not sure if this has to do with being under staffed, or if it has to do with them saving tables for the 'invited guests', but I felt the twenty minute wait was unnecessary. 

Then getting through the buffet line was a hassle in itself. There wasn't a lot of open space between the dessert island and the actual buffet. It was like a herd of cattle trying to make their way to the food. The layout of the buffet is good, it just needs to be more spread out.

And then there's the issue with the carving stations. I think this was one of the reasons why the buffet area was so congested. The people handling the carving stations were half assing it. They weren't working diligently to help people. They would carve some meat for someone, then walk away. Or they would be handling two different carving stations. Once again, I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but it was 6 pm on a Saturday. The Buffet should know to expect a lot of people during this time and should plan their staff accordingly. 

I was willing to ignore the wait and the layout of the buffet, because I felt the food would make up for the wait. Wrong. 

First, I was really excited to try Kobe Beef. I've never had it. So this was the first thing I went up and got. So I bring it back to my table, and the only knife I have is a lousy butter knife. I went up to look for a steak knife, and they didn't have any. Have you ever tried to cut steak with a butter knife? Butter knives are not meant for steak, hence they are called butter knives, and not steak knives. 

Anyway... I was determined to try kobe beef, so I battled on with this butter knife. Wikipedia says that Kobe beef refers to the meat as ""generally considered to be a delicacy, renowned for its flavour, tenderness, and fatty, well-marbled texture."" At the Bellagio however, the meat was really tough. I struggled with my butter knife to cut this piece of flesh, and when I was eating it, I felt like I was eating warmed up raw meat. It was not tender at all, and I had to chew it a lot. Maybe I'm food retarded, but I didn't think this meat was anything to praise. I didn't even finish it.

Next up, I tried the prime rib. I love a good prime rib. The prime rib at the Bellagio Buffet was very fatty and very generic as far as buffets go. I still ate it, because I like prime rib...but it was still ehhhhh. I had better prime rib at Ellis Island. 

I had some other assorted food, that was all very meh. Yes they have all you can eat crab legs, but they were cold and there was hardly any meat to each leg. Yes they had cold shrimp, but I can get that anywhere. 

The desserts weren't that great either. This was another thing I was looking forward to. I had been drooling over yelp pictures for weeks before I went to Vegas, however, when I was finally at the buffet, I felt like there wasn't as much of a selection from what I saw on the pictures on yelp.

Anyway, this buffet was average. It should have probably been about ten dollars cheaper. If you want good quality  food, you might as well go to a regular restaurant for the same price.

Fast forward to now, I've been back in this neighborhood for about 7 years and we have only had 2 Subways close by for sandwiches. I'm kind of a sandwich junky so when I saw this Goodcents open up I was sooooo stoked!!! I had to try it the next day and let me tell you it's up to par with all the other Goodcents I've had. 

Here's what makes Goodcents so special, their light and fluffy bread and deli sliced meat. This is what makes it better than the competition. They have a great selection of fresh toppings, but so does everyone else. They have chips and fountain sodas just like everyone else. You can get some fresh baked cookies, same as the other guys. But you have to come here for delicious bread and deli sliced meats...unless you like mediocre bread and meat served up on plastic wrapper things, then you go to one of the 2 Subways in the area.",u2_tsVD586yAzV643YP2eA,5,5/9/2016,1,review,1,The Strip,SEABLUE by Michael Mina

News flash, if you don't give your customers what they want they will not be happy, very likely to not come back, and share with their friends. 

Everyone MUST know I really enjoy this place... The quality, service (minus below), and cleanliness. So what has ticked me? :-) Next paragraph!

It was 3pm and I had yet to have lunch, I have after school pick up for my son and thought it'd be great to bring my son a mini spam burrito. Just spam and rice wrapped in seaweed very much like a spam musubi. They have a burrito with spam but action packed with all sorts of other yummies wrapped inside of it... The price is a little under $8. Well if you know the cost of spam, rice, and seaweed well HELL NO!! I will not pay $8 + tax for it. I asked who seems to be a partner/owner or manager if that price can be revisited as I'm looking for something much simpler and for a child. I feel most of the businesses offer kids menus with lowered prices etc... Well I was very disappointed with the answer of... NO with the reason being that they had already preset the price. So at the risk of losing a customer (me) who comes a few times a month with friends who now also come... Well you get the idea the reasoning makes zero sense to me. By no means am I asking for something free, nor deal hunting but what's right... Spam, rice, and seaweed should not cost $8+. At that point Hawaiian Style Poke, WINS-best of both!

Again, I enjoy my bowls and burritos here. The food is great... I'm specifically writing about this experience that will send me back to Hawaiian Style Poke or Soho Sushibowlritto where they listen to customers as well as have kid options.",V1EdIokE0YYN__dNYfXRdA,3,10/15/2016,2,review,1,Other,A1 Mobile Catering

The food, service, and ambiance were perect.  One of the best dining experiences we've ever had.  First off, you can get lost in the bread and butter that they put in front of you.  The bread is a soft corn bread and the butter is sweet and creamy and light.  We shared the scallops which were fantastic.  Fresh, flavorful, delicious.  The best I've ever had.   I had the fettuccini with root vegetables, fennel, celery root, and wild mushrooms- as good a pasta dish I've ever had.  It was served in a light miso infused sauce of some kind and was seasoned perfectly.  My husband had the lamb, which was cooked perfectly.  I had a glass of alberino, which was delicious and reasonably priced.  We were too full for dessert.  I'd go back in a second if I was ever again in Cleveland.  We enjoyed dinner at Crop more than we did at Lola's, and we greatly enjoyed Lola's, it's just that Crop was a better overall dinning experience- food, service, and ambiance.

This restaurant, I don't know honestly. It didn't meet my expectations. I was actually expecting more and it was a disappointment. First, my date and I ordered the Albondigas and the waiter wasn't paying attention and spilled the sauce on the table (annoying). It got on my shoes and my dates wallet and phone. 

My date ordered this chicken dish that had chipotle sauce and it came in a nice presentation. After he had a taste, he asked me to try it and ask if it was suppose to taste like that. The taste of the dish was so flavorless. Think of it as the sauce and the chicken having no flavor. The chicken was over cooked and dry. 

We did ask the manager to try something different because we were dissatisfied and he recommended a pork dish that had plantain chips. He brought us samples of the pork to taste and it was very good.

I ordered some street tacos Al Pastor and they were okay. It didn't make me want to have more after the first taco (3 come with the order).  

I would say the service was great. They did go above and beyond to ensure we were happy. The food in the other hand was a 4 from a scale  from 1-10 (10 being amazing). 

The drinks are good. I had a Paloma and it was delish!

Service was good on both visits but the hostess won't sit anyone until the whole party arrives so that was a tad annoying. 

I tried:
Nutella Milkshake - amazing!!! The nutella was prominent and it was plain addictive. Pretty huge for one person, best to share since nutella is quite sweet
Strawberry Banana Shake - pretty darn tasty, surprisingly light for a shake and not overly sweet
Cookie dough Shake - Not my favourite, had chunks of cookie dough with most of it blended in. Just like a light chocolate doughy shake

Lamb Burger - Well seasoned, a little gamey with a nice kick from the spices. Not bad but not my favourite.
Salmon Burger - Amazing. The salmon fillet came looking like a patty (round) which was a tad alarming BUT it was just cut that way. Fresh and cooked a little rare in the middle, which was fine for us. I had it with a side of aioli n on a potato bun (both were delish). Zucchini fries were disappointing though.


Definitely be back since they open late, so we were able to go for a quick snack & nutella fix~",Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ,3,12/31/2011,1,review,0,Southeast,Flavors Of The World

My date and I had a reservation before seeing a show.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our server Juan who was very friendly.  I asked if there were any good ""must have"" orders for cocktails or food and he made recommendations.  The cocktail that I ordered was spicy and had a pepper on the edge of the glass...I'm Mexican and can take the ""heat"" but it wasn't only ""hot"" but also an infusion of tastes...no, not boozy (who wants that?!) just many fruity tastes mixed with spice.

I'm not a big fan of raw fish, but Juan recommended the yellowtail.  I was feeling adventurous so I ordered and tried it and OMG it was delicious!!  Those little sweet potato shreds and horseradish sauce just took it to a level of DELICIOUS.

We also ordered the steak tartar, ahi tuna cones and stuffed piquillo peppers (stuffed with goat cheese...perfectly done!)

If we'd had more time before going to see the Eagles concert, I'm sure we would've explored and ordered more.

Highly recommended!  Enjoy!!",_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw,5,2/18/2014,0,review,0,Southwest,Smokey Mountain BBQ

My wife and father-in-law had the chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly. The maple glaze and crisp coating really made the dish. The waffles were okay - they were a bit dry.  His wife ordered the ahi tuna special. I tried it and it was well seasoned, seared, and served raw. Very solid. 

My dish was the big disappointment. I had the cab ribeye. I've had it here twice before but it was a summer style preparation with a tomato/arugula salad. Regardless, the ribeye in the past was amazing.  Not tonight. First, it was boneless. Which is usually okay but not preferred. But, the cut of meat was this circular spongy glob of meat. It was very, very fatty and just had an overall strange texture and taste. I sent the steak back. Our waitress was going to prepare another steak but came back and told me that the chef said all the cuts tonight would be the same way. That's disappointing for future diners and disappointing that a restaurant of this quality would not have better cuts; especially considering this was the only steak option.  I didn't order anything else due to the timing and the fact my wife could barely eat half of her chicken and waffles. 

After dinner, we had the Baked Alaska dessert which was very good. Then we had a quick vault tour which was very unique and interesting. Much better than I imagined it would be.

Ordered:

Veggie Burger, not bad. Generous size makes this a 4/5. Gluten free bun was perfect.  Could use more seasoning but it was late and they accidentally gave me free fries which were terribly addicting. You will probably overeat but it will be awesome. 

I take it you'll be tipsy / drunk coming here which will make it taste better. 
Not sure how the meat options are. I'm rating this as if I were vegetarian.

They have a vegan option which is a giant stack of grilled vegetables between portobello mushrooms that comes with fries for $12. I was told it was good.

If you're in a huge casino with lots of shiny lights, loud noises, and lots of distractions, hey it happens.

So we finally find this tiny to-go bakery behind the escalators. I thought it was more of a sit-down cafe type of bakery. We peer into the glass case and everything looked so good. Then I saw the prices, especially for their french baguette sandwiches which looked like a skinnier version of Lee's sandwiches. It was $9.

We ended up getting a croissant and two macarons, all of which were huge in size at over $3 each. I know it's not a large sampling of what the bakery has to offer, but everything tasted just okay. For some reason, I thought the croissant would taste better than the ones from Costco (gasp!). 

The macarons remind me of giant cookies, like the ones the Cookie Monster eats holding it in one hand. They were light, semi-chewy, and not overly sweet. I can't quite describe it, but the smaller sized macarons we had at Miette Patisserie in the SF Ferry Bldg tasted like it had more depth in flavors, if that's at all possible in a non-savory dessert pastry.",aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw,3,7/14/2009,4,review,2,Downtown,The Spread Sports Book & Deli

I have tried all the restaurants in Pittsburgh that proclaim they serve Korean food and have been mollified with mediocrity on many occasions. That is why I think think this is by far the best Korean restaurant in the 'burgh. 

One of the best things I liked about Dasonii was that there was no pretense about it being a Chinese or Japanese restaurant that serves Korean food on the side. I understand that sometimes you need to cater to the unwashed masses but Korean food should be celebrated as it's own style that can stand by itself. Pittsburgh can be rather parochial at times, so imagine my surprise when I ordered the appetizers and I asked if the dumplings were Chinese dumplings (aka pot stickers) or Korean mandoo. The waitress told me that they were homemade mandoo and acted like I should expect nothing less! 

The dining area was neat and clean without too many gawdy Asian decorations. The waitress was prompt and provided our table of seven (2 adults and 5 children) with great service. We had two Korean food virgins with us that were picky eaters so we stuck to the tried-and-true dishes that just about everyone likes. We ordered the fried mandoo, seafood and scallion pajan, dot sim bi bim bap, bulgoki, chicken bulgoki and jap chee. Everything was great!

We were really impressed with the atmosphere and the food at Chuy's especially considering that we were there for there practice run night.  This was the first meal served by the restaurant and we had nothing to complain about. If you don't know from my other Tex Mex reviews I deeply love Chili Rellenos and have not been able to find a decent meal of them here in Charlotte. Every restaurant that serves them here serves them soggy, not crispy like they should. Chuy's comes out with a nice fresh pepper that's coating is crispy and delicious the way it should be.

Not only do they have them but they also enjoy the Hatch chili at Chuy's and celebrate the Hatch Chili Festival in August. I will no longer have to order a box from Hatch, NM. I can now go celebrate my obsession locally at Chuy's with the rest of the Hatch Chili crazies.  Once you've had them you'll understand.  For the festival and the chilis alone I would give them 5 stars, but they also really pulled off a great experience for us on a practice run night and we just loved the feel and atmosphere of the restaurant in general.  There is a great bar area for fun with friends. But, try and get a seat outside if you can. The view is very relaxing. The fountain and play area for the kids is just awesome too.

Pino's is one those increasingly rare environs in the USA, a no frills family owned restaurant. First time diners may occasionally get a dose of family dynamic's that don't fit there ethic's or social graces. Hence the occasional negative review. Few people these days understand what it means to work sun up to sun down 6 days a week to make a living. This is the reality of a family restaurant ... you can't always be at your best. I myself have never witnessed any odd behavior, and Pino is the nicest guy you'll ever meet, as is his night time wait staff. 

Like many Pizzaria's in the New York area, Pino's is  a cafeteria style high volume take out environment M-F for lunch. Learn the ropes to get feed at rush hour or .. No Soup for You!  Ok I'm just having fun here but you get the idea. Afternoons are slower but I usually avoid that time period because of the limited menu. Evening's are when you want to visit for a true Pino's Al Centro experience. 5-8 PM. 

My friend Matt is a regular over here and lets just say the man can eat. Though him I have learned what can really come out of this kitchen, yes some real 5 star specials. Though him I also learned of the ""Italian Style"" Margarita Pizza ... this thing is off the charts, I actually dream of eating this pie. A super huge funky shaped pizza with a super thin crust ... bubbling with gooey goodness ... Oh Baby Baby. Unfortunately its not on the menu. I myself only get one 50% of the time, and never through the wait staff although they say no problem, a ""regular"" Margarita Pizza always shows up. (Still very good but not the madman).  My only success is to ask Pino's directly, an if he's busy its not going to happen. The only reason I am sharing this is because if enough of you ask, just maybe, ""the italian pie"" becomes a permanent feature on the evening menu. My best success is Saturday's around lunch time when it's slow.

Pino's Al Centro is a 30 mile drive for me but I stop in every chance I get. Homemade everything, quality ingredients, straight forward Italian Food. Everything on the menu is a solid 4 star,  a real comfortable family style restaurant with great service and affordable pricing. What's not to like.

I wanted to find a good local Chinese restaurant to satisfy a craving for Chinese Chicken Salad. Persuaded by the favorable YELP reviews, we decided to try out Amlee Chinese Cuisine for dinner. We loved it!  The moment we entered the door we knew we were in for a treat. The soft lighting in the restaurant gives the room a feeling of intimate dining. The place is clean and the tables are well spaced. The atmosphere there is just perfect for dining & conversation. 

Service & staff...THE BEST!

Maria & (I didn't get the other server's name) are absolutely exceptional. We were served promptly and both ladies treated us with such a courteous, warm and friendly manner, that it made us feel not only welcomed, we didn't want to leave. Actually, we were the last customers to leave the restaurant. Upon, leaving the restaurant, the impressive Wall of Fame caught our attention and the maître d graciously shared a bit of history about the restaurant and the owner.  

Dinning: We ordered Amlee's Appetizer Plate, Shredded Chicken Salad, and Eggplant with Shrimp because it was one of the specials for the day.

Was there a favorite dish? Was there a least favorite dish? NOPE, because everything is was great! We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Simply stated the food is good because there is a subtle balance of flavors and everything was prepared with perfection. Serving size are well portioned for sharing a meal (we took home leftovers) and the pricing good, too.

Atmosphere: Warm, but a little too cozy
The lighting in this place adds a well needed warmth on a winter's day. Upon entering the establishment to your left is the cash register and to your left would be the immediate seating. The seats were comfortable enough to sit on. The seating is very tight, and if the entire indoor dining area was full, it would be very difficult to navigate. Good thing there is a dining area outside! 

Food: Not bad at all!
I've had a taste of the chili cheese dog, French fries with dipping sauce, and their sliders. All of these tasted wonderful, each with great flavor and served nice and hot. The only other thing I would like to say would be that the food here is pretty expensive. $8 for 3 tiny sliders? Although they tasted OK, it's not really a good value at all. Their menu does serve some pretty interesting sounding items, but the price of the food is the deal breaker in this case.

Service: It was... AIGHT.

Admittedly it's a rather mundane restaurant chain but it delivers on what I need it to - enjoyable meals with my mom. Their calamari is crunchy, the toasted ravioli appropriately fun finger food, and the soup is surprising.  Why? Because my number one soup there is minestrone. And it's vegetarian and I am not. Not in the slightest. But there is something about dunking those warm breadsticks into that tomatoey broth that makes me slurp it up with abandon. Of course they have all the classics, and my favorite is chicken fettucine alfredo. Big white sauce fan (it's cheese!)

 The cook was amazing, he brought out our food in a timely manner after I had gone up to order, he described to us what we had ordered and even asked if we needed anything else, any more chips and salsa and if everything looked good. He could barely speak english but he was not hard to understand and totally made a great representation.  

THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT! The Shrimp Mexican Pizza, and the Ceviche were really really Good! I would recommend the food however I would have to mention the service....

I am not sure if I would come back, and Its a shame becuse the food was superb however the Service from Our bartender was just shitty. She was sweet towards the end and did check on us Once after our food had already came out, she said she was new to this location however I don't think that excuse had anything to do with her customer service I just wish she had a little better training in the Hospitality department especially with her being a graveyard bartender, thats the time a lot of service industry workers come have dinner and play the machines!",_PQ1cKw_ZtKrXNxCMgIeYA,2,10/19/2014,0,review,1,Summerlin,Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant

Super super crowded at the bar and on the dance floor. Luckily, me and my group were ushered into VIP and got to dance looking over the crowd on a stage. The night was a little hazy, I can't remember much about the DJ or music....but I had a fun time! 

I found the decor both unusual and stunning. Stone Buddha statues and candles are grouped together in various parts of the club. The go-go dancers are hot! They basically danced/gyrated half-nude in large stone basins filled with rose petals.

It's a little misleading though because the Groupon states that it is for ""Grape Street Cafe"" but the address listed is the original Grape Street. I had to call to confirm this was the correct location. 

Once we arrived we were seated promptly along the brick wall. Loved the ambience, it reminds me of my favorite bars and restaurants back home in the South Side of Pittsburgh. It was a Wednesday night with a good amount of people dining. Waiter greeted us with bread and water. We ordered the Crab Stuffed Shrimp as an app which was really good.  There weren't many items on the menu that I was in the mood for so I went with the famous steak salad and it didn't disappoint (I ordered it with romaine lettuce instead of iceberg). The steak was flavored so well but the rest of the salad was pretty plain. My only gripe is the description of the salad said it came with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  I asked to hold the feta but the olives were also no where in sight!  I love olives :/. The boy ordered Stuffed Manicotti and he loved it as well.

Was like having a private room without being cut off to the restaurant atmosphere. Decor is modern and simple. Bar tenders very attentive and we were served quickly cocktails sized appropriately. Moscow mule also a popular cocktail with our group.

Greek salad big, so shared by 3 which was plenty with dinner.  Friends enjoyed the flavorful mussels - great sauce. Had filet au poivre which was tasty and tender. Thought it should have been plated with gravy on the plate then filet and then topped with potatoes. Instead the gravy was pored over the filet and potatoes giving it a pot roast look. Nonetheless I enjoyed it. Husband had Delmonico said it was OK but was disappointed with roasted potatoes he sub for Broccoli Gratin.  Said they tasted like they were out of a bag, overcooked, dry and tasteless. I had same ones but they were smothered in gravy. Were fine for me.

Loved the Fire and Ice desert (lava cake with ice cream). Baked perfectly with a tender cake shell with yummy warm rich chocolate center. Others enjoyed the Double Chocolate Ganache.

I've always liked Mario Batali's food philosophy and I just read Joe Bastinach's Restaurant Man so I was pretty excited to try this place. It was right in the middle of the faux square with music and the fountain and everything which set a nice mood for the man date with my friend before we hit the blackjack tables.

We split a good bottle of Gewürztraminer and people watched for while. Our waitress was  nice and attentive. The arugula salad with pecorino Romano was the perfect start to a pizza dinner. I ordered a white pizza with wild mushrooms and, all in all, it was good. The crust was a little too crunchy although it was as thin as I like it.

I can't give it a five though because my expectations were high and the price was high relative to the value. I know it's Vegas but, come on, pizza is pure margin.

Will definitely push for that next time. 

We ordered the edamame and two share plates - rock shrimp and tempura crab. The edamame was unique - came in two dishes, one with rock salt and the other with chili sauce. The rock shrimp was good but the sauce was too creamy for my taste. The crab was, hands down, the star of the show. Huge chunks of crab. Tasty (ponzu?) sauce. We also had the chocolate lava cake which was delicious, although not very lava-y by my standards .... I like my chocolate to ooze. Our drinks were amazing - I had the blood orange and my bf had the kiwi (this will make sense when you see the drink menu). 

One gripe - I hear they have super nice bathrooms, but when I went they were shut down and I was (sternly) directed out of the restaurant.

70041,9,8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,Qlk2raxwJGiDERyzQgXaWw,"Oh Tommy, oh Tommy, you have let me down!

I have been patiently waiting and waiting for a Tommy's up on my side of town.  I have been watching the countdown for the new store on Craig to open for months now.  I was so happy today when I saw on Facebook you were finally open.  My heart was all aflutter and I couldn't get over there fast enough to grab a ridiculously messy and oh so good chili cheese burger and fries.  And then it went downhill...

First, the location itself is tucked into a corner of a big shopping center.  There are only 3 parking spots near the restaurant.  Otherwise you have to park and walk across the entrance to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic.  People were driving all sorts of crazy in this area, so be careful walking around here since there really isn't a clear path to walk on.

I actually had to do drive thru today because my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over.  It is easy to get into the drive thru, but really tricky once you have picked up your food.  The driveway is very narrow and quite close to the building.  I drive a mid-size sedan and it was tight.  I feel bad for anyone is a big SUV or full size truck.  Pay attention or you might hit the wall.

Next, the order taker.  She was really quite friendly, but was on the pushy side.  I needed a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later.  I asked to have a minute to check the board.  I think I got maybe 15 seconds before she was asking if I was ready to order yet.  There wasn't a line, so I am not sure why she was in such a rush.  

I went ahead and ordered and then she asked if I wanted to upsize my drink for an extra $.50.  I said very clearly, ""No thanks"" to which she said ""Ok.""  I assumed that meant I would getting a regular sized drink, silly me!  I get up to the window and she hands me a large soda, which I was totally charged for, so it wasn't just a mistake by whoever was serving up the sodas.  I told her I said a regular and she said she thought I said to upsize it.  I wasn't in the mood to argue, so I just took the drink.  I mean I love soda and can easy drink 2 liters in no time, but I am trying to be good and cut back on my soda addiction.  So much for that!  It was just fishy, in my opinion.  I don't know if the girl really made a mistake or wanted to improve her up-sell totals.  So watch out for that trap.

Next was my burger order.  I ordered a regular chili cheese burger.  I specifically asked to have no onions because they are yucky.  The girl told me that they only put onions on burgers if you request them.  I said great and to please keep them off of my burger.  So you can imagine my surprise when I got home, having been drooling over the burger next to me for the last 3 miles, and then took a big bite into my burger that was covered with ONIONS.  Ugh.  I have never seen so many onions, it was almost like i got an extra helping of them.  Fun times for sure.

So after I took a bite into my onion infested burger, I had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onions down.  Guess what?  The soda mix was totally off.  I mean the place had been open for 2.5 hours by the time I was there.  How was the soda to syrup mix already goofed up?  So yes, I paid extra for gross soda.  

On the positive side, the burger was super tasty (once I picked all of the onions off) and smothered in delicious Tommy's chili and cheese.  The fries were simply amazing! I have no shame, so I scrapped all of the extra chili cheese off of the paper they were wrapped in. Yummmm, cheese paper.... If you haven't tried a Tommy burger, you really need too!

I still love Tommy's, even after all of the messes listed above.  I am giving this location the benefit of the doubt and giving them 3 stars.  It is their opening day, so maybe everyone is working out the kinks.",BQKPbuILIAG53XtIZ51s5Q,3,9/25/2013,9,review,6,Westside,Sakina Thai Cuisine

This building was formally a bank and even walking in feels grand.  The walls and ceiling are beautiful and the room has large neoclassical pillars that whisk you away.  
We were seated at a table, but it was chilly and then we noticed the amazing bar by the kitchen.  We relocated and it was the right move! We were able to sit near the pass and I felt like we had booked the chefs table in advance.  
We ordered cocktails, both delicious.  As we were making selections the chef brought over a tasting of beef bacon (not on the menu) with slaw dressed in a delightful sauce.  It was great and a perk to setting by the kitchen. 
For appetizer, we had the cherry bombs. They were very good and have a strong southwestern flavor.  Chorizo is hard to say no to and these were again very good, but we probably wouldn't order them again next time.  
We also had the scallop appetizer and was slightly let down.  Maybe because I had Mediterranean for lunch and and the flavors felt to familiar.  Also, it is high in citrus and just didn't fit my wine or mood.  
My entree was the veal chop and at $45 I expected something amazing.  I was not let down.  So tender and although I am not a raving mushroom fan, the topping is outstanding!  It is served with a potato cake that completes the chop well.   Paired with a nice mild red.... I was a happy girl. 
For dessert, (don't judge me) I had the inverted s'mores. It was Ah-freakin-mazing!  Holy cow... Graham cracker ice cream... I didn't even know you and after one encounter - I am in love!  The  dark chocolate and chocolate marshmallows were perfection and the wafers of meringue blew me away.  A must try!

Crepes are thin, crispy and perfectly cooked, and filling choices are varied with something for every palate.  Fresh ingredients, great flavor combinations.  All that being said, I gave this place only 3 stars for the way they treat customers.  Their posted closing time is at 3 pm, but be prepared to be given the boot a few min after 3 pm.  What restaurant does that?!  I've never been directly asked to leave at 5 min after ""closing"".  They started breaking down at 2:30, carried away the self-serve drinks, swept, closed out the till and set chairs on tables well in advance of 3 pm.  Then at 3:08 pm asked us to leave.  So basically, this place should state their hours are until 2 or 2:30, but not 3 pm. We arrived before 2 pm, expecting to have a little over an hour for our meal - we did not expect to be promptly asked to leave at 3 pm.  Both good food and good service are necessary for a thriving restaurant business.  If you don't love it, don't do it.  And if you want to close up early and ask customers to leave,  perhaps you should build ejection seats into the chairs so you can get rid of those pesky customers finishing up their meal as soon as possible.",HgdFqAvK31fB9sgBdOzo9g,3,5/18/2013,1,review,0,Centennial,Subway

The decor and ambiance were outstanding. It has a somewhat over the top Rat Pack era Vegas thing going on, which was great. There was a live singer the Saturday night we went. I half expected the ghost of Dean Martin to breeze in the door any second. This restaurant is relatively far off the Strip down East Tropicana but they will purportedly send a limo to pick you up. I didn't see this limo but if it is anything like the decor in this place, you'll most certainly turn a few heads as it picks you up in front of the Bellagio. 

The food is traditional Italian. Lots of pasta dishes that you'll probably be very familiar with. Service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and the items we ordered came fast. They ran out of Cannelloni that we ordered and threw in a free desert because of it. Nice. Old school service.

The lasagna they did have was nicely done. Plenty of meat in meat sauce, and cheese in the product. Well seasoned and flavor. It was served at the right temperature - not scalding hot like many lasagna dishes you get. 

The eggplant was pan fried and then served with red sauce, cheeses and a side of pasta. It too was very good. Portions are not ridiculously large like they can be in some traditional Italian restaurants like this, which is good because if you're staying in a hotel, you obviously can't take anything home.

DO NOT COME HERE FOR DIM SUM!!!!  I REPEAT...DO NOT!  

My family and I frequent this place regularly for dim sum.  But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here.  

1st - they now charge $1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn't mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up.  But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever. 

Service is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I'm Chinese, and trust me I'm used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese.  But this has got to be the worst I've had in a long time. 

Sat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware $1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server.  15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food,  and Chinese broccoli cart.  The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something!  Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself) figured we load up since it took so long.  The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items.  I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said ""I don't have it.""  

I finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, ""the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one.""  In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us!  The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table.  So I decided to place one order and ask for the check...we were fed up at this point. 

The waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill.  She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts.  So damn frustrated I said NO!  I can't wait anymore, I have to leave now (by now it's 90 minutes).  She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill.  I finally said fine and agreed.  15 minutes later...no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention.  Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool.  

$50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work.

After checking around for dinner places to celebrate our 25th anniversary, we decided on Casa di Amore based on other Yelpers' reviews.  We wanted someplace off the Strip that locals might go to.  And boy, did Casa di Amore deliver! It looked & felt like old Vegas, during the Rat Pack days.  The décor, the entertainment, the 'feel'; it has it all.  An added bonus was it was half-price wine Monday.  ALL bottled wines are half price!  

The service was above & beyond from our waitress, Lynn.  She let us taste a couple of wines before buying. (She also let me try the gnocchi before I ordered but asked me not to tell so this is our little secret.)  Hubby had the rib eye with cabernet demi-glaze & peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to perfection. I had the gnocchi florentine with prosciutto in a white wine cream sauce. Lynn said we can request any ingredients be added or removed so I added sautéed mushrooms.  M-M-M!  Desert was a wonderful tiramisu.

In the wake of my offensive lunch at the gravely overrated Winghart's 2 months ago, I felt I had a duty to warm a seat inside Market Square's other burger joint, the under-heralded Diamond Market Bar & Grill. 

Self-described as ""a casual place that's neither uppity nor a dive,"" Winghart's shatters against DMB&G upon impact. 

My meal's only downside was in the Classic Deviled Eggs, which gets you a trio of bisected hardboiled eggs served with a yellow ""four-pepper sauce."" The sauce, which kicked like an angry stallion, saved the eggs from complete mediocrity. The creamy, yolk-derived filling was scant and listless. The whites of the eggs themselves were akin to silicone rubber. 

DMB&G staff: Contact my mom; she makes better deviled eggs than I've had at any restaurant. Like many of her hallowed recipes, it is simple. Email me. I aim to help yinz. Seriously. Deviled eggs should be on more menus in Pittsburgh, and they absolutely rule when chilled, your deviled eggs' only other saving grace aside from the nice microsalad of pickled vegetables that accompanied them.

I mean, if you guys didn't make such an outstanding California Burger, and your cute, red-haired waitress by the name of Olga (trust me, she's a petite knockout) didn't do her job with such dexterity (they were insanely busy!) and succeed in charming the boots off of my feet, I wouldn't bother. 

That magnificently mushy beef cookie was on-the-target medium rare, oozing with meaty liquids that were absorbed adroitly by the bangin' Brioche bun. A spread of mashed avocado and chipotle-lime aioli furthered the decadence and pushed the burger towards the Mexican border while bean sprouts added a light, healthy, green-tinted 60's (Mr. Big reference), crispness to the body of the patty. Tomato, flawless shoestring french fries, a cold dill pickle, and a swell, creamy, crunchy cole slaw kept it in the realm of tradition. 

And speaking of tradition,as new as DMB&G is, it epitomizes ""classic"" to the point where one could fool a tourist into thinking that it has been fixture in this nook of Downtown for decades. 

A lively, gabby crowd that ranged from young professionals with loosened neckties to grizzled laborers with grime on their foreheads packed the dining room and bar so tightly that I almost went elsewhere assuming that I'd be unable get a table. Taking a chance, I entered the establishment. Fortuitously, a hostess happened upon a small table in a corner of the spirited room, one that appeared custom-made for dining alone and proved ideal for watching the jolly carnival of common folk that unfolded as I indulged in some fine grub. 

Even the bathrooms were tastefully retro and a joy to use. Pin-up girls illustrated by the late Alberto Vargas embellished the clean, white, tiled walls. I normally don't pay much mind to restrooms unless they're exceedingly rank, but DMB&G deserves a citation of excellence for their men's lavatory. The only omission was an attendant. 

With bags full of confections culled from stops at both Prantl's and Sinful Sweets beforehand, I had no reason to order dessert, even if the items on the menu sounded tempting. 

DMB&G doesn't try to be hip. Rather, it strives to impress with platters of good barfood and mugs full of class. Winghart's has been shot out of the sky with an aim as true as Pittsburgh itself. Pretension dies at Diamond Market's doormat.

P.S. I'm comin' back to try their barbecued ribs and those desserts of course.",Fr5R5w74Xg7sKMlt4PPtHg,4,2/25/2013,8,review,8,The Strip,Cabo Wabo Cantina

We sat for a while without being greeted by our server and then when she showed up she let us know that she was very good at what she does - btw...she is very mistaken...oh right...and happy anniversary (the only thing that happened for the event) not sure why they ask. (small token chocolate??)

She brought our drinks, took our order and that was about the last time we saw her.  Someone else brought the mediocre food, set it down and left.  My husband has entertained business guests a number of times and has been served an assortment of bread which either isn't done anymore or was left out.  We asked someone as they went by if we could have bread, he said it would take five minutes - wow!!  Two rolls came out on a plate that were hard as a rock and cold - microwaved for sure.  He ordered salmon, which was good, but the broccoli was cold.  I ordered chopped chicken salad which was drenched in dressing and I left half behind. Not once were we asked how are meal was by anyone.  

Our glasses sat empty and we were never asked if we would like anything more to drink.  I finally asked for another club soda with lime and I was brought a glass of warm soda water, no ice or lime.  I asked if I could have ice, and she brought a cup of ice. Guess I have to combine the two!!

She did drop the check off and someone else finally picked it up to process it.  After much time, we had to flag her down - ""oh, did I not bring it back to you?""  Nope...that's why we are still sitting here!!

Needless to say, she was the worst server we have ever had (and we eat out a fair bit).

I would have never even thought to step one foot in the place if I didn't see this establishment featured on the Food Network television show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  You may have seen the show, it's hosted by Guy Fieri, who looks exactly like an over-bleached obese porcupine and who's on-screen talent seems to be limited to the ability to simultaneously stuff enormous bites of bad food into his mouth and mutter ""awesome"" or ""totally-off-the-hook"" or ""too-legit"" or some other outdated, cliched, catch phrase.  

If the show has a quota of each of the three classes of restaurants in the title, then Crystal definitely adds a +1 to the Dives category.  It's a dump.  The ""restaurant"" is nothing more than a tiny (~15ft wide) rectangular space most of which is occupied by a dive bar.  There are a few tables in the back of the space, which is windowless save for two small windows at the entrance.  For ambiance, the back of the bar has a couple of televisions (which were blaring college football when I was there), a pile of old electronics junk stuffed into a corner niche, and a few videogames.  The interior is painted flat black - or possibly just coated in decades of cigarette smoke and other grime, which seems likely given the stale cigarettes and beer smell the permeates the place.  For an added special touch during my visit (which occurred around Halloween), one of the videogames had a pumpkin sitting atop it, with a carving in the pumpkin that depicted the silhouette of a man mounting a woman from the rear.  The fact that several of the tables had children didn't seem to deter the restaurant from displaying this extra special decorative treat.  I almost forgot - one wall is also covered with portraits of the owner's family throughout the 1950s and 60s.  It's a very strange sight indeed.

So the TV episode showed that the owner, Crystal, is of Middle-Eastern descent (Lebanese, I think), and her specialty is, of course, Middle-Eastern food.  So we started with the hummus.  It was your basic, chickpeas-out-of-a-can hummus with lemon and tahini.  It was served on a plate with very thin, right-out-of-the-bag, cold slices of pita.  They didn't even take the time to toast the pita.  What was even more puzzling is that the pita was cut - not in wedges, or in some other uniform shape - but seemingly in random sizes and shapes.  WTF?!?  It looked like a 5 year old was allowed to cut the pita.  Some pieces were huge, some tiny to the point of being impractical to use to scoop a bite of hummus.  Strange.

My entree was a lamb kabob which was served along with grilled peppers and onions.  The lamb was good, properly grilled, and succulent.  The grilled peppers and onions weren't seasoned at all - not even a hint of salt.  The dish was served with those randomly-shaped cut pieces of cold pita.  Most of the pieces weren't even large enough to wrap around a single cube of lamb.

All in all, the ambiance stunk, the food was mediocre, and I was afraid to try a draft beer due to the generally unclean appearance of the place (I ordered a bottle).  I cannot imagine why anyone would prefer this place over other Middle-Eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh (Aladdins, for example).

If ever I'm feeling lazy and not wanting to make my own salsa - I'm going to hit up the salsa bar here.  I've tried the salsas with food from the food court and it's always tasty.

And speaking of the  food court - I've eaten here quite a number of times.  Very tasty no mater what you get.  And I've almost gotten it all.  Last visit, I purchased some pulled pork to make my Cubano Rollups.

It's NOISY - it's a great place for a lively conversation, but you have to really strain to hear.  A little attention to sound absorption would make it more pleasant - we found that the conversation from the table next to us was reverberating off the wall right into our space.  (There was live music, but it wasn't intrusive - it was nice.  The problem was the overall clatter and din.)  

Second thing is wait-staff that rolls in and verbally tramples whatever you were in the middle of saying.  The interruptions got really annoying after the first 20-30 times.

The service was excellent and I felt bad because they tried really hard but the food was mediocre. (Hence the 2 stars for the service and cute decor. The music they played was kind of odd as well; contemporary music which seemed out of place!) 

Back to reviewing the food... The lamb curry was neither lamb nor curry. Kind of bland and Americanized. Wanted to feel the intensity of the curry and taste the gamey-ness of the lamb meat. The kebab sampler was okay. The prawns in the sampler were delish (but you only get 2!!) but the rest of it was average. I have had better food at a food truck. I really appreciate value for my money and I don't mind spending a lot but I want to have a dining experience where the food is delightful and wows me. And for $25 a plate it did nether delight me or wow me. Too bad I really wanted to love this place and make it my go to Indian spot.

Anticipating my first experience at the Greenhouse Tavern (after reading so many wonderful Yelp reviews) I suggested we grab a table on the patio and enjoy the evening.  

The hostess seated us and handed us the late night menu. Now, I do not date a small man. My 6'4"" boyfriend hesitantly sat down on the tiny metal chair provided, praying that it would support his frame over the course of the meal. Thankfully, it did, but its not the most comfortable situation for a large man to be in.

Drink order: I requested a glass of the house red and a Coke for my brother (who is fifteen).  Instead of being offered whatever cola the bar uses for mixed drinks, the waitress brought us a Grown Up Soda Dry Cola that markets itself as ""100% natural"" and ""Not Too Sweet"". Don't get me wrong, its not a bad soda, but my 15 year old brother's non-discerning palate didn't know the difference. Essentially we were up-sold on a product we didn't want.

Dinner order: The late night menu offered a number of fine options. My boyfriend opted for the risotto, which he could not stop eating. My brother had the famous burger, another great choice.  I however, had the booby prize. I chose a tomato / mayo sandwich. Although it tasted delightful (particularly the mayo), the portion was laughable. It was essentially the size of a biscotti. I left unfulfilled and went home to enjoy a turkey sandwich. 

All that said, I would give the Greenhouse Tavern another shot, but only when their full menu is available.  If that happens, I will update this review.",GIfZNMP0oIJCje_Xp0Bgrw,2,7/22/2010,0,review,0,Sunrise,Angelina's Pizzeria

The person that answered the phone was extremely rude and did everything possible to deter us from wanting to place an order at all. After going in circles for 5 minutes, he finally said place the order over the phone and pay when you come in.
Once there, the owner came over and sadly he was just as rude and unaccommodating. Our orders totaled over $80 dollars. I guess he didn't want our business.

I think it replaced a sushi spot ironically called ""AYCE Sushi'. So far from the looks of it, it could be a solid sushi restaurant in this part of town.

I haven't been to the previous restaurant before it was called Tomo Sushi, but I can guess it used to be a teppanyaki restaurant or a KBBQ. I can't tell which one it was. But it doesn't matter now, because all that matters is that it's Tomo Sushi. Yes... Tomo Sushi. Not to be confused with Momo sushi even though it sounds the same. Tomo is the word. And the word is the bird.

Speaking of birds, lets get to the appetizers. I ordered a bunch, but I forgot to take pictures of a lot of them. So sue me. It's ok. Actually, don't sue me. I got a Who's your daddy, and Who's the mamma. I think that's what its called. The one with the crab stuff inside the jalepeno. I liked it. I thought the jalepeno could have been cooked a little longer, but it had a nice snap. Crackle and pop. Another thing that I enjoyed were the calamari. They had a light tempura batter. It was all good in the hood. Ordered a bunch of other stuff, I thought all of it was pretty good.

Onto the nigiri. First, all of the fish and shellfish that they used was pretty fresh. And, I thought that the rice was good as well. A special shoutout goes out to the octopus. They do a really good job with their octopussy ;-) James Bond would approve. Sean Connery, not Pierce. Gotta go with the legend on this one. Not the backup. Not the Garrafolo to the Brady.

Yesterday, the Maui special was the best tasting out of all of them but it still just didn't deliver.) The Philadelphia roll was okay and we were actually only given one unagi roll even though we ordered two so we shared the roll and I actually felt bored eating it. There was no flavor at all. It tasted like I was just eating rice. 

At the end, we were still charged for two unagi rolls and we almost didn't catch the extra charge. One of the servers (there were three different people helping us the entire time) apologized for the extra charge but didn't offer a refund, just offered that we took it to go. So we did. Out of all three people there was only one girl who I actually thought was genuine and nice. The other two were just there to get their job done. 

Overall, for $20 for a couple of flavorless rolls and choppy service? I guess if you're looking to not spend or eat too much... Or if you don't care about the service then you could check it out.

I love when I get to show off Cleveland, how much it has changed and grown, and going to E 4th is a no-brainer (yes, fully aware there are hipper places to go). 

Our server was fantastic, zero complaints about the service. He was knowledgeable about the cocktails, the beer choices and the menu. We ordered several small plates- the Jerky was meh, very sweet, a couple of the thinner pieces reminded me of a bad, meat fruit rollup. The fried cheese poofs were great, I don't normally like pimento cheese. Pass on the pork and peppers, they are simply way overpriced fried pork rinds. 

I may have made a mistake in ordering their steak, assuming it would be far better than a steak I would make at home. Especially because, as the menu proudly states, it is ""ohio's only certified angus beef."" (Fun fact, over 85% of the meat you eat is Angus. There is zero difference between certified and non-certified angus beef other than the needless markup.)
The steak itself was only ok. It was cooked just fine, had a nice char to it and was the right amount of pink and temperature for medium. I found it to be lacking in any flavor whatsoever, sorely disappointed.

I would, however, highly recommend their animal fries. A really good take on poutine. 

I'd try it again, but will wait until the menu changes as well as not getting the steak.",GIfZNMP0oIJCje_Xp0Bgrw,3,8/11/2016,1,review,0,Summerlin,Jasmine Thai Gourmet

We were staying at the Hard Rock so we dedided to check out the strip mall across the street. Kaizen Sushi was closed at that time, and even though I couldn't see what the inside looked like, the sushi craving kicked in.

We came back later on and I am so glad we did. I ordered a couple of rolls, one being The Hungry Roll.. oh my god! it was enormous.. I would have been good with just that!!

We went back another time with a pretty large group of friends and they were very accomodating. I tried some of the baked rolls, which were delicious and not so heavy as my beloved tempura rolls. Eveyone else's food looked good, and no one had any complaints. I had the Lychee martini which was very tasty. We also got the party started with shots with ty ku.. sooo yummy! I wish they had it in L.A.

Overall, I love how it is nice yet very casual. Also, they have such a big selection of rolls!!!!

My only complaint (which wasn't the restaurants fault) is that we had them call a cab for us and we waited for about an hour and they never showed up.

We came on a Sunday with a hungry party of 5. No, line and we were instantly greeted and seated. 

Like the real rocket scientists that we are, we ordered a large sample of the menu:

2lbs Snow Crab
2lbs King Crab
3lbs Shrimp
2lbs Craw-fish

The seafood was quality; no complaints on the size or freshness of our feed. My beef is with the seasoning. I've been to many a boil bag seafood places and was blown away by the taste. Yes, there was alot of sauce but for some reason none of it stuck with the meat?!? Once the seafood was extracted, shucked, cracked, peeled or decapitated, there was not much taste left?!?  Maybe they didn't let our stuff soak long enough in the bag? I know that it's possible because I've eaten at other places and the sauce penetrated (hehe) the shells and soaked into the meat. So yah it was a bit of a disappointment for me. 

Questions:
Why do they only serve corn and potato with the crawfish? (notice the singulars) I wish that they offered it with all of their bags. When we drop $200 + on a seafood feast, that's the last that can can do. How do you decide who get the one potato or corn among 5 people? Don't nickel and dime us when we are spending mad money here. 

Why do they not have mixed bags? I think it's a bummer if you want to sample everything and didn't bring a large enough party.

Maybe we will try the one across the street to compare. Maybe...

The only issue was that the restaurant doesn't allow more than 50 people per floor which would be difficult for a large reception. The restaurant is 3 floors with bars on the ground floor and rooftop. The rooftop bar is pretty cool on a fri or sat night for people watching. 

Anyway, to the restaurant. It's located on the busy 4th St in downtown Cleveland. If you dine at the restaurant, easiest place to park is at the valet parking on 4th. You prepay whatever price and then the restaurant validates the ticket for you, bringing the price down to $8 so you'll get some money back. 

We made a reservation for 5(a must for fri or sat night) and were promptly seated at a table on the 2nd floor overlooking the promenade. We had heard amazing things about the pig face so we ordered that and the beef short ribs first as they take 45 min to prepare. To tide us over, we ordered 4 appetizers (cabbage salad, animal style fries, chicken wing confit and fried brussel sprouts). All of the food was really good and excellently prepared. The chicken wings and brussel sprouts were surprisingly on the sour side, a bit too much for my liking, but still excellently tasting. My favorite ended up being the brussel sprouts. The animal style fries covered in curds, gravy, bacon and a fried egg were really good too. Definitely something to try if you've never had poutine. 

The short ribs and pig face arrived promptly and wow was it a site to behold. Half a roasted pig face with some vegetables and bread. And then 5 lbs of beef short rib in all its glory. The pig face was tender with some crispy skin. The meat and fat just came right off of the face. If you're squeamish about meat with faces, then you should stay away. If you're a brave soul, definitely try it as it was amazing.

The short ribs were also really good, fall-off-the-bone meat with lovely roasted vegetables. It was really good although I've had similar flavors before so this wasn't too special to me. Just really well prepared. Ordering both may have been overkill for 5 people. Probably should have gone with just one and then ordered another appetizer. But having too much good food is a pretty good problem to have.

Overall selection of food was pretty limited.

The Sushi:
The rice was old. I mean there was no other way to say it. It was not fresh rice.
If I make rice at home and 4 days later I unplug the rice cooker and leave the lid all the way open for 24 hours because i'm dumb like that, then slap a piece of fish on that crusty left-over rice and put it in the fridge for 2 hours to make it extra cold, then I'll have the same kind of sushi as I had at TI. It was bad.

The sea food was ok I guess. None of it tasted really fresh and it was all heavily seasoned/baked/slathered with stuff.

The crab legs were decent.

The potatoes tasted like they had been sitting out there for quite a while.

I couldn't bring myself to eat the dessert afterwards but the comments from the rest of the table were less than positive.

I'm not a buffet hater since I do go to buffets occasionally, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.

You better be plastered drunk AND a starving zombie to come in here and pay full price. Sorry, not for me.",7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,2,4/30/2012,0,review,0,Other,Big Mess Bar-BQ

I'm guessing most of these reviews are by tourists. we had ribs, coleslaw that was more like cabbage salad, mac and cheese the typical tangy barbecue sauce. which after we waited for 10 minutes for the hot stuff to be delivered to the table that was very good! the layout of the restaurant is kind of strange everywhere you turn is kind of a dead end. the fixtures and chandeliers are awesome. definitely sit by the window because the booties that go up and down that corner are amazing. happy hour pricing was reasonable 3 till 6 on drinks and about five items on the menu. 
I live here, I doubt if I'll be back. but then again most people that live here only go to town center to pick up a booty call, meet people and drink. YOU WANT LOCAL BBQ...Rolling smoke in an industrial area. So if your a tourist, go during daylight hours.

Our wedding was Steampunk themed and so this restaurant was the perfect choice and it did not disappoint in the slightest! We had 16 people and they set up the private room with one long table diagonally across the room and it was lovely.

The food is absolutely magnificent and it is obvious that they care about the food and the menu. We had one of the set menus for our group with an alcohol package and all servers were friendly and helpful and made it a special meal for us. The beef was absolutely divine, some of the best I have had in a long time, along with all of the other dishes served on the night. All of our guests spoke very highly of their meals. 

Of special note was our main host Freddie. He greeted us on arrival and had already very kindly unpacked some of the table decorations we had dropped off on the previous day. He also helped us setup our cupcake stand and place all our Sprinkles cupcakes that we had had delivered that afternoon as our wedding cakes, all with a smile and joking with us. He even introduced himself to my new wife when she arrived as 'the cupcake guy'. :)

Because it was our wedding reception Freddie took extra special care of us and had their awesome mixologist (and Bar Manager) Eric Smith (big shoutout as he is AMAZING) concoct two amazing cocktails especially for us! He named them the Time Traveller and the Steampowered Dragon Breath. They were both insanely good cocktails and we absolutely loved them!! (He even wrote down the ingredients for them afterwards for us to take with us). We look forward to returning to sample some more of Eric's work.

Because it was a themed wedding, we and all of our guests were dressed in costume and they had no problem with us taking photos out the front of the restaurant and inside it with our professional photographers. They were very accommodating and lovely and I can't recommend this restaurant and it's staff highly enough!

Freddie made it a fantastic evening, coupled with Eric's amazing cocktails. A BIG thankyou from myself and my wife for such a fantastic evening.",_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,5,8/5/2015,1,review,1,Downtown,Top of Binion's Steakhouse

We chose Il Molino because we were turned off by B&B's menu of offal such as sweetbreads and lamb's brain.  There is no way my husband will eat oxtail, rabbit, wild boar, or duck liver.  Too authentic for us, I guess.
But Il Molino ended up being a great choice.  The romantic classic dining room was warm and inviting.  When we were seated, tuxedo-clad waiters (more than one) promptly arrived to set down napkins and menus and carved chunks of aged parmesan from a giant wedge for all of us.  Additional starters included thinly sliced fried zucchini, sliced salame, beautiful rustic bread, outstanding bruschetta, and mussels - we didn't order any of these things.  It just came.  Our waiter spouted off a long list of specials and even brought a tray of langostines to the table to show that they were part of the specials.  

We ordered veal rollatini with prosciutto and mozzarella, pappardelle bolognese, angel hair with tomato and garlic, lamb osso bucco with saffron risotto, chicken picatta, and fettucine alfredo.  Of course, we were all full from the appetizers by the time the giant-sized entrees arrived. 
All of our dishes were very good but not outstanding or incredibly memorable.  The cuisine is classic Italian, so the menu, although it has terrific variety, isn't incredibly inventive.  However, seeing familiar dishes makes the food very accessible.

We ended with a dessert sampler which included pieces of tiramisu, molten chocolate cake, zabaglione with berries, and ricotta cheesecake.  Again, everything was great.
In my opinion, what you pay for at Il Mulino is the stellar service.  Not sure if any cappellini pomodori or fettucine alfredo worth $26.",8yiLVWzJyyTEhYE0fVNvlA,4,3/6/2009,0,review,0,Spring Valley,Famous Dave's Barbeque

After spending the day hiking in Utah and then driving 4 hours back to Vegas, we were tired, disheveled, and hungry. It was our last night in Vegas. My dad had raved about Mastro's mac n' cheese for years. So we decided to have some for dinner! 

I admit, I was a little worried that we wouldn't be treated well, being that we were not ordering high priced steaks or seafood. That was definitely NOT the case. We had extremely attentive, first class service the entire time. We decided to eat in the bar so we wouldn't take a table away from steak lovers, and since we were more casual. There was live music, which was loud but not impossible to talk over. 

Our waitress was just awesome. She explained to us that the portions of the sides were huge and we definitely could share. We appreciated this since we didn't need leftover food. We ordered mac n' cheese, asparagus, and drinks. I had the paloma, a grapefruity drink. It was good! Not overly sweet. My friend loved her berry lemonade. Bread was brought out and was very fancy! There were different kinds of rolls, crackers, breadsticks, and pretzel sticks. Very yummy! 

Our meals came out and WOW... the sides were huge! Our waitress served us everything... and whenever we finished, she came to refill our plates. Very classy! We ordered pomegranate martinis on the way through our meal and again... WOW. They were amazing! Order one! They come in a shaker, and are poured table side. There is enough for more than one. The waitress came over and refilled our glasses as needed too. 

We finished every single bite of the mac n' cheese and asparagus. And were full. Too full for dessert. The meal was $100! I can only imagine what it would be with steaks. But it was $100 worth it.

Everything was chocolaty and serving size was just right. No left over for us! Lol

We enjoyed our first time here and would definitely come back to try their food choices and of course more of their chocolaty goodies. A must try when you are in the area.

My friend and I ordered everything on the event menu: fried pork wontons with egg drop soup, egg rolls stuffed with cabbage and BBQ pork, and orange chicken. The meals came with tea, too. 

Due to the event, we were seated in a side room. It was very drab and badly need of updating. The cement floors were cracked and the bathrooms were scary. The waitress was nice but neglected to ask us what we wanted to drink. When she brought the food, we had to ask for water. Also despite knowing we were sharing, she didn't bring us any extra plates. Annoying. One thing I forgot to add was when we first got there, we stood waiting in the lobby trying to figure out how to be seated. There was a sign with an arrow to the dining room on the right for the event, but it didn't specify to seat yourself. After seeing several employees at the register not ackowledge us, I finally asked what we should do. Then she told us to seat ourselves. 

The food was good. I especially liked the egg rolls and orange chicken. The orange chicken was actually delicious. Although I liked the food. it wouldn't be enough to bring me back.

Yes, the prices seem up there because you think, it's just chocolate.  Let me tell you, it's not JUST chocolate here!  

Honey and I came here thinking they only served desserts.  They actually offer real food!  We were so bummed because we were searching for a place to eat brunch and couldn't find anything appealing.  Next time we are definitely going to check out their non chocolate offerings because not only did everything on the menu sound delish (fancier offerings than your basic breakfast), we witnessed people eating and we were looking at their food with longing.

We had already eaten and honey is not a real fan of just eating sweets so it was all on me.  The pressure!

I first ordered a drink to try.  Ha!  These aren't just drinks...they're an adventure!  My $7.50 Mocha Frappe (milk chocolate truffle and espresso shot) was offered in their Alice ""Drink Me"" cup with the metal straw.  The metal straw kept my very thick mocha cold to the last yummy drop.  It wasn't overly sweet so I was able to finish it.  He thought I was going to get sick finishing that and eating a dessert.  I did prove him wrong thank you very much!  Okay, I did feel a bit nauseous later but I would do it all again in a heartbeat.

I ordered the Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu.  The lady fingers were espresso soaked and sitting in extremely thick cognac mascarpone cream.  So thick was the cream that your lady fingers would break in half when you pulled them out.  You had to use a spoon to eat the lady fingers with the cream.  The chocolate truffle surprise was a warm gooey thick chocolate drink in the cutest mini glass pitcher.  I felt like a giant Alice drinking it.  Thinly sliced ripe strawberries were given as a taster in a teeny 

Chocolate overkill?  Yes, yes it was.

*Pork Belly Slider- YUM YUM YUM!  This was more like a full size sandwich on a delicious and soft homemade pancake.  The pork belly was prepared perfectly and had just the right amount of fat to add flavor yet not be greasy.  

*Dan-Dan noodles- We ordered the wide flour noodles.  The broth was spicy with a touch of sweetness and topped with peanut paste.

*Pork Soup Dumplings- Large portion and perfect taste!

*Sweet Egg Yolk Steamed Bun-  This was a really good ""dessert""!  The buns are  so soft and fresh, but with a duck yolk right in the middle.  The yolk is prepared with honey and vegetable (think of a custard consistency).

Decided to eat there on Sunday night after checking out their website and seeing that they sold 1. Collard Greens and 2. Fried Pickles!  From their website I was able to reserve a table through Open Table.  However I did not see where there was a cover charge for Sunday.  (Fri-Sat only).  OK  no big deal.  $5 later to get in when the band was on break.  We were seated at a table right in the front row with a clear view of the band.  Great.  I ordered the Fried Pickle appetizer and the cat fish as my entree with a side of collard greens.  The pickles were great but the sauce was too salty. The catfish came out hot and was great as well.  The collard greens were barely room temperature and dry.  I like a little juice in mine.  I won't be ordering them again.
The house band was very good!  The male lead singer/lead guitar was awesome.  I could have listened to him all night.  The female singer that came out had a great voice but no stage presence.  She looked as if she was a robot programed to sing.  Not to mention all the fidgeting.  From her dress to the ear piece.

First of all, this place from the outside is very underwhelming, as well as the inside of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.  That being said, you are coming here for an authentic meal, not to be wowed by a fancy foyer and cool looking art on the walls. Note - This is a BYOB (savings!)

The food here is as authentic as being guests in a Cambodian families home.

It's a small mom and pop restaurant, with a very extensive menu.   It's entirely run by a family, from the Mom making the meals to the daughters serving you while their Dad oversees things.

My friend Jane and I both had the Combination Coconut Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt.  It was very fresh and tasty.  I had them prepare it medium spice, which is definitely tempered to a midwestern palate.  If you are looking for an Asian Spice level of medium just mention it when you order and they will oblige.

My wife had the Chna Bun Kari, which she also enjoyed very much. 
The 4th member of our table had the special (the name escapes me) which again, he said was excellent.

 The portions are quite large so keep that in mind while considering an appetizer or dessert.

Facility:  Small joint with about 10 tables and 10 counter seats. Very clean, quaint fast food style with lots of sports memorabilia on the walls to keep your eyes entertained. 

Service:  I approached the lady at the counter who identified herself as Lindsay, and after finding out it was my first time, she immediately went into the description of what they offer and what is popular. She was so friendly and helpful!!!  You can tell she is someone who actually enjoys her job...management give her a raise!  ;)

Food:  together we decided on the #4, which had a Chicago style hot dog and a beef half sandwich, their two most popular choices. 
The Chicago style dog was loaded with toppings and delicious. I ordered mine with no onions.  
Then the beef sandwich was served ""wet"", which means they dip in it au jus for you. I got this with cheese and Papa's Giardinera hot pepper mix on top. Loved the sandwich and the peppers were just the perfect amount of spicy. 
The French fries were some of the best I've had in a long time. They were hot, freshly cooked shoestring fries with a mild seasoning salt. Just amazing!
Then to really put my experience over the top, they have a calendar with unique specials everyday.  Guess what today's was??  A free hot dog for anyone whose name begins with ""L"". Score!!!! 
So, I got that one plain and Togo for later. 

Overall:  just loved this little spot. Although I don't like to give a lot of 5 stars out to fast food...between the service, fries, and the free hot dog, how could I jot?!?!
It is kinda outta the way, but since I have appts on this side of town, I will be back again to try something new. You gotta try this spot too!!!!",WmLTIN4qzZ8SjpPxsPH27Q,5,2/13/2015,4,review,0,The Strip,La Salsa Cantina

First off, I will digress. I learned a lot about Chinese food this weekend. Chopstix is noteworthy for serving ""east coast"" style chinese. I am from the midwest, so I was intrigued. Apparently ""east coast"" style chinese is more Americanized. Its more heavy sauce based/ deep fried based than your average ""west coast"" chinese. I definitely found out after eating at Chopstix that I love east coast chinese food haha. I had always wondered why chinese food in Vegas left me so unsatisfied, and its because they are so different on the two coasts! Who would have thunk?

Delivery was fast and the food was still hot. Everything we ordered was prepared very well and had lots of flavor. The thing we liked most was the value. We got enough food for 3 meals each for about $10 per person. This place is now one of my favorite for chinese in vegas.",xmeEyBVC5zN-FCX5qZviIQ,4,5/5/2014,0,review,1,Chinatown,Jack in the Box

One would think that would not be so difficult, but after our last experience, you can see why she was hesitant.....thank goodness I was driving, or I may just have starved.

Now for the night's meal....it was so much better than our last experience so I deemed it an extra star......it is still lacking the consistency, but this time, our server was spot on! 

My wife almost placed a bet with me that the meal, and service would be a repeat of our last visit.  I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).

The meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.

This was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.

I have given three stars, as I mentioned earlier, it just isn't consistent enough to receive 4 stars.

We did have newcomers throughout that ate and ordered cocktails. But generally you wear out your welcome quickly after your meal is finished. I can not say how much I enjoyed this place.

Just about a buy nine, get one free deal. I found that four sliders is plenty for me and I could probably be fine with three if I also had fries or rings.

I really like the fact that they actually bring the food to your table vs. calling out a number and making you run up to the counter. They use real brewed iced tea vs. bag in the box, which is a big plus for me. The onion rings are good, though nothing fancy.

There was so many high and low points with dealing with the inside of the store and the employees. A couple of positive points were how I was given a sample plate of all the side dishes, and I was given my drink for free. The low points were how it took close to 30 mins to get my order while watching multiple people order and leave with their food,  and while they had sweet tea, they didn't have non-sweet tea. The reason why I got a free drink.

Some of the worst tasting ribs I have tatsed. They were very chewy with a tatse as if the grill they were cooked on hadn't been cleaned in ages. Not having a lot of flavor on their own, I had to dip them in the bbq sauce that came with the order so I can finish them.

The mac and cheese and cole slaw that I ordered was decent. The mac and cheese tasted as if it was made with real cheddar,  and the cole slaw wasnr overly sweet and had a nice tatse of pepper.

Another ten minutes go by STILL no one comes.  
Okay... SHIT happens.  I get up and leave the theater (like you would at a normal theater where drinks are only $3) and go ask the very sweet bartender if I can get some assistance in the theater because we've pushed the button and could really use some drinks.  She says absolutely. 
I kid you not 15 minutes before the movie ends a girl (who was not the person I ordered from) rudely asked what we needed.  Really!?!?!  
For the price that you are paying for the ""experience"" service should be included.  And if you provide a tool to help with that service it should be used.  And when it's  used and you fall short when I ask for help (politely as I totally get it the things happen) don't  be rude.

My friend and I got a front row seat on the bench right in front of the window where the noodles and dumplings were being made. Sitting right there led to a bit louder experience than others since the chefs were throwing large slabs of dough (I won't ruin it for you all!) but it wasn't overly intrusive, just something to think about.

We started with the Soup Dumplings. I've never had soup dumplings in the past but these were unbelievable, definitely the highlight of the dinner. The dumplings were steaming hot, full of flavorful broth and well seasoned meat. The dumpling was a great texture, not too chewy, and it came with fresh ginger and soy sauce.

Next up was #46 Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. That was a nice dish, smooth brown sauce with an almost smoky taste and minced pork served with wide noodles. It was not overly flavorful but simple and good. We also had the #38 Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake and while I don't usually eat onions alone, this was excellent. Crispy on the outside with great flavor (wasn't oniony in my opinion). We rounded out the dinner with some vegetables, Broccoli in the brown sauce.

Egg and pasta station were a plus and so was the BBQ station. I wasn't particularly impressed with the salad station, Asian food, and the International section. The desserts were well versed, something for everyone.

The only bad thing about this visit is that the hostess decided to stick us at the smallest table in the restaurant where if you moved in the wrong direction just by an inch, you would be making contact with another customer at a different table.

Boy...we sure were sorry that we hadn't dined there sooner!!  

First of all, we were greeted pleasantly and promptly upon arrival, and there was no wait for a table...even on a Friday night.  The waitress was professional, prompt, and friendly throughout the meal.

The menu was at least 4 pages long, maybe 6, and it was LOADED with a wide variety of reasonably-priced Greek, Italian, and Mediterranean specialties.   I had the chicken shish-kabob, and it was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned.  It was generously served with Greek salad, rice, and pita.  The other orders at our table included the chicken shawarma pita, Greek gyro, and fajita chicken sandwich, and we all shared a serving of jalapeno hummus which was surprisingly mild.  Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals and the entire restaurant experience.

I'm only taking a star off for the environment.  It's just an odd atmosphere.  There is absolutely zero Asian flair and the music is a bunch of crap from the mid 90s.  Not romantic in the least bit.  Want some Alanis Morissette with that sashimi?

Another thing is the guys in front(within the hour of 5pm today) ""taking care"" of the people walking in for orders were entirely, as a crew, inefficient. Tylor/Taylor talked too much in front of customers. He even asked a customer to write down what she wanted because he could understand the acronym his job uses. I mean seriously? You work here right? Milo seemed lost and was very quiet. Even when calling orders I could barely hear him, and I was literally the first person on the other counter. On top of that he got my order wrong. Missing 2 pieces of chicken from my order and a whole box of 12 biscuits which I paid for. It's honestly not the food but the incompetence of doing uiur job.

As soon as you walk in, you are seated quickly and they bring you some of the best chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. And then they bring you refills of chips and salsa until you finally think that maybe you should stop and save some room for your actual meal.
So then when your food does get there, the first thing you'll think is ""Holy crap that is a lot of food!"" But it is AMAZING. I have only ever had the carne asada burro, but I don't think I'll ever get anything else from here. It is a pillow-sized burro stuffed with chunks of steak, cheese and roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. SO GOOD!! My husband has had a few of the other things and he swears that it is some of the best Mexican food that he's ever had, too.

So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do with the card?"" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry.

The buffet price is among the higher priced buffets in Vegas but the food is simply average, nothing more,  nothing less.  The variety is lacking and some of the food just isn't good.  

The servers are good here they keep your glasses filled and are quick to remove your plates. I also do have to say that I love the coffee at MGM I'm not sure what brand it is or who makes it but it's always super smooth. 

If you are staying at the MGM and want a buffet this is the easiest thing for you. If you want a buffet, there are so many in Las Vegas I recommend skipping this one and trying one of the many others out there.",#NAME?,3,5/15/2015,1,review,0,Southwest,Burger King

Service was great (as should be expected at such an establishment). Our server also made suggestions for food and drinks. I went with the  ""Breakfast Americaine"" (Two eggs any syle served with bacon, country sausage, pommes frites & toasted brioche) and a mimosa.  As far as what I selected for brunch, i was not too impressed. I understand that my selection of brunch cuisine was a bit generic, but the price versus the quality was not what I had expected. Eggs were done well, bacon was crispy, country sausage was not as appettizing, but the frites & brioche was pretty good. I will say that i have has better frites. 

Atmosphere is great. I have to been to upscale establishments where it can feel a bit stale. At brunch, the atmosphere is much more upbeat and without the snobbery. Also, layout is well done with indoor and outdoor seating.

54175,0,7GGeURmnvZQlPY8DaifiTQ,YsXB5j-9dEyi7qKcAXSpIA,"Best Japanese restaurant in the valley! And I mean Japanese food... not just sushi... not that their sushi is bad, quite the opposite, BUT I just think that Yasu shines more in their other fare.

Although not of late, I'm an avid customer... at one point, my sushi buddy and I were quite chummy with a busser, Leo the bartender and Assa, a waiter there. Love how the staff yells out Welcomes (Irashaimase!) and Thank Yous (Arigatou!) as you enter and exit... just as if you were dining in Japan!

As it is a small place, it can get full and a wait may be involved, but trust me, it's worth it. I however, usually arrive for a late dinner--past 8, so most of the time I don't have any problems getting seated. I think it's best to come here with lots of time on your hands, good company that will keep your eye off your watch and how long things may take to prepare... it'll help your experience greatly. And, during peak dining hours, make reservations!

Now for the food. My favorite dishes are the Shrimp Noodle Skewers (Who knew you could wrap shrimp with noodles--and the chanterelle cilantro dipping sauce... soooo goood!), Fried Calamari (So prettily presented--I love the Cod Roe and thin strips of seaweed that tops the small tower of squid goodness), Agedashi Tofu (Love the mini shimeji's), and the Sumibiyaki! Bacon wrapped Asparagus is my fave! Oh yes, Bistro wings are also tasty (But makes me yearn for a side of white rice)!

For sushi, my sushi buddy and I are quite frugal and simple, sticking to they lighter rolls: Eel & Cucumber, Spicy Tuna (Best ever--and this coming from a hardly ever raw sushi eater), and the Kanpyo Roll (Gourd Strip Roll), out of the specialty rolls, I think my favorite is the Red Roll... I love the IDEA of the Yasu Roll, but hate the fact that the sushi falls out from the slippery cucumber wrapping... there's got to be a better way to execute the outer wrapping... maybe go thinner? Also of note is the size of the rolls are smaller... which, IMHO is better, your supposed to be able to pop an entire sushi in your mouth. I think they are rightly proportioned with that rule in mind.

Dessert is one of two choices IMHO: Chocolate Souffle with Yamamomo on the side (If you're sharing, ask for 2 Yamamomo's!--They may charge you, but I think it's worth it not to share the tart little fruit) OR the Tempura Ichigo (Strawberry) Mochi Ice Cream--DIVINE!

P.S. At first I was against this place... saddened that a more expensive restaurant had replaced my inexpensive sushi choice (R.I.P. Cafe Kobe) that also sold Boba drinks and crepes--even wrapped it burrito style and sliced it up depending on how many you were sharing with... but after eating at Yasu, my frown turned upside down into a BIG GRIN. Yes, Yasu's menu is a few more bucks to shell out, but oh so worth it!",oZcbn7ENit23xbCsyu9xbA,5,11/17/2009,2,review,1,South Summerlin,Salute Trattoria Italiana

4) ordered the Mongolian beef extra spicy, it was milder than I'd ever had it there before when I ordered it regular.

5) Mongolian beef was 75% onion, 5% mushroom, 20% beef. I ordered Mongolian BEEF, not Mongolian onion.

6) as I was getting my bag from the counter I noticed a large bucket (like the orange home depot ones) sitting on the floor with a large wooden spoon in it, no lid, and full of red sauce (I'm assuming it was sweet and sour).

I have been here many times, for office parties, and just for snacks. I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table, the food is high end bar food (I mean that in the nicest way) and is well portioned so you are always on the verge of finishing or having a small take-home, and the beers are great with an always available seasonal variety along with the regulars. They have a nice outdoor patio for the good weather seasons. 

I guess the only thing that is inconsistent here are the servers - we have usually had above average servers but occasionaly you will get one that feels too busy and is just running the food around such that you may wait on drinks. That is how I would capture our most recent visit - sat in the bar area at a table and the server was friendly at first but eventually had trouble coming back to check on us very often.

Some cool things - they give you samples normally if you want to decide on a drink, and if you want to buy a growler to take home, these are a good deal because they allow for cheap future fill-ups on your next visit.",ejaUQ1hYo7Q7xCL1HdPINw,5,12/6/2011,0,review,0,The Strip,America

I'm guessing it's because I never got that server/bartender guy from my first visit again. Yesterday I came for afternoon tea with a friend and we got the Champagne Cream Tea which comes with tea service, scones, cream jam, finger sandwiches, pastries
and a glass of champagne. I actually had two glasses of tasty champagne because my friend is allergic, so I think that made my experience even better ;)

The portions that you get for your $25 are actually pretty big compared to other afternoon tea services in town. Each person gets a glass of champagne, 6 little sandwich triangles, 2 large scones, and 3 mini desserts. It took about 15 minutes for them to bring out the 3 tier tea stand with the goodies, so we just drank our tea during that time. I knew from my previous two visits I had to drink it fast because all the tea leaves (and there's a lot of them) are just floating in the pot and it doesn't get strained until you pour it into your cup, so it gets very bitter. After eating the sandwiches, which were a little dry, I was already feeling a little full, but I couldn't resist their delicious scones, cream, and jam. Their cream is homemade and so light and fluffy. My favorite mini dessert was probably the chocolate one with a hazelnut crunch. It tasted like Ferrero Rocher chocolates. 

Overall, I still have yet to come here for their regular menu, but so far I love their tea service and it's a great deal. I'm not big on their sandwiches though, so next time I'll probably stick to the Sussex Cream Tea service and mix that with some of the small bites on their happy hour menu which is around the same time as Afternoon tea.",mShOJ9qFk79KnZq7E8k9hQ,4,12/24/2011,2,review,0,The Strip,Table 10

Food: The first time I had their sandwich at a friends place it was a mozzarella and prosciutto conglomeration of epic amazing awesomeness.  Then when I found out the Chicago connection (as I'm from Chicago) even more cool points awarded.  

Second time, I wanted to try their entrees, so I fired up the pesto gnocchi with shrimp and that too was delicious! The shrimp was fresh tasting and gnocchi cooked to perfection. Large portions too! There were like 8 shrimp! 

Ambiance: Third time went in and fired up another prosciutto and mozzarella sammy and checked the place out. So it's setup like this.  Part store where you can buy all things Italian food, then a deli counter with all types of options (Italian meats, chicken salad, etc), then a counter where you order off menu for to go orders, and then also a sit down restaurant area with a server.  The got it covered!  They have a tv in there and it's totally casual.  I did see some white wine in a fridge that you could likely buy if you wanted to drink it there but didn't see red wine, but I'm sure it's there!  

Service:  The service was great, the gentleman who took my order was very sociable and my sandwich came up very promptly.

the French toast... well I guess I chose to ignore the ""bread pudding"" part, but this was nothing like French toast. it was like a super sweet melted apple pie in a stack. it was much too sweet for breakfast and I'm a chocolate chip pancake fan. just didn't want an apple pie for breakfast. It's the kinda thing that's so heavy and rich that you buy one for your table of 10 after eating breakfast so you can all say you had a taste. No one or three people would finish this.

and I felt sick all day from it. Idk if it was just too rich or oily or what. I drank gallons of tea to get rid of the feeling.

I got a good amount of bacon on the side though.

my friends chicken and waffles were okay, the chicken was pretty good, the waffles were pretty good, with chives and bacon peices. the sauces were strange, a think gravy/salad dressing zesty sauce and a thin maple syrup.

over all the bread was the best part, the prices weren't worth it. I'd stick to pastries.

I'm a wimp when it comes to spice but my husband loves it. Shrimp Enchiladas with green sauce. So creamy, so soft so... heavenly. Comes with sliced avocado on top.

The hostess led us towards an ""upstairs""  booth, but quickly recognized that my elderly mom doesnt walk that well, and offered ""lower level"" seating instead.  We didnt take it, but I cant tell you what a good impression it makes when the first person who greets you ""gets it"". Someone who anticipates needs rather than waits for you to explain them. 

Our server was good too. Pleasant, but not overly familiar or chatty, and absolutely efficient. No mistakes.   

My favorite (and least expected) discovery was what I think they call a ""Healthy Menu"" or something.  Shrimp Macho (ok, stop laughing)  had six good sized shrimp,  shells removed, quite nicely seasoned and pretty well cooked.  It was $7.95 with standard mexican combo sides. I thought it was a very good value, and if the sides were better, an outstanding one. 

Lunch for two, which includes a big basket of chips, was $20 before tip.

Why only three stars, when my apoplectic rant (see below) bestowed two? Well, the chips and salsa are pretty bad. The drinks come in those awful little plastic ""glasses"" that hide dirt and god knows what. The back of the booths provide zero back support. It's just not a five, or even four, star place. 

But today's third star represents a wholesale change in at least one customer's opinion of Carlos.  It will probably never be my favorite spot, but I previously railed that no one here ""gave a shit.""  That's obviously changed and is worthy of mention.",YM-nYIHd99qUt9n62AxIAg,3,2/9/2011,2,review,1,Eastside,Port of Subs

This is a fantastic hole-in-the wall type of place that I love. 8-9 tables and a waiter. Clean, but DIY.  

Food - We had dinner - a la carte, not buffet. For apps we had the excellent veggie samosa - hot, freshly fried with lots of different vegetables in a bit of sauce. Some places put too much potato, but this was an excellent example. We ordered a second round. 

The naan is excellent. Crispy, light and chewy with a ton of clarified butter. 

For dinner we ordered the chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, and chick peas. The server offered us spiced heat on a scale of 1-10. We chose 5 but it came out closer to 7 (in my opinion) so manage your selection accordingly.  The chicken was smoky and the tomato sauce nice and thick. The rogan josh had small chunks of lamb, and the brown sauce had a nice hint of ginger. Both of these standard-bearer dishes will not disappoint. The chick peas were unremarkable with a more watery sauce which was over spiced - closer to an 8. 

When we ordered dinner we also ordered mango and salt lassi. For some reason the server didn't want to bring them during dinner - maybe I missed the memo that in Bangladesh they are to be consumed as dessert. After asking twice he did bring them after he had cleared our dishes. Not worth the wait. They were watery and the salt lassi was a sweet lassi which had been oversalted... Oh well. 

So service, or maybe the culture of the place, and the fact that it is a hole in the wall, result in 4 stars. But stick with the standards and manage your expectations and it's a great indian meal in Pittsburgh.",fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw,4,4/8/2015,2,review,0,University,Adam's Ribs

- The place was EMPTY, yet we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.
- The high chair we were given was broken, and we were advised just to ""tie in"" the toddler with two mangily straps hanging off the chair.
- We ordered drinks, and beers.  We received water and no beer.  After waiting 30 minutes for the drinks to be brought to us, we eventually got up and went straight to the bar to get them.
- Food order was majorly screwed up.  Of our party of 4, each one of us received a meal that did not match our order.  We sent the waiter back and forth 4 times before our orders arrived as requested.
- The side salads we ordered with the meal all came in different sizes.  Of all four of us, two received a huge salad stuffed into a tiny bowl.  The other two received a huge bowl with a tiny salad.  How do you screw up a side salad?!
- Burgers are AWFUL!  Seriously, I took one bite and stopped.
- If you expect your meal to arrive with all the items as described on the menu, think again.  Apparently, the menu is not wrong - but you are wrong if you ask your waiter for the missing ingredients.

The list goes on, but I'll stop here to save on the over embarrassment of the establishment.  It was a pitiful meal and a terrible experience.

Banana Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce

Having heard rumors of Bertha's serving the best bread pudding in The Valley from more than one trusted source I took the opportunity after a long morning run to visit the small shop on Indian School Road while my family was in town and selecting widely from their freshly baked early morning selection I'm happy to say that although I personally think Cornish Pasty Company, Del Frisco's, and Vovomeena all make a better bread pudding the lady's at Bertha's still turn out a pretty great rendition of the dish along with one of the best muffins and cookies I've had in Arizona.

Ordering eight items but only receiving seven (after calling them they admitted forgetting to pack up the sweet and salty brownie - something I still need to return for as they reportedly have my name written down somewhere) only the apple scone proved less than excellent as it was simply too dry, but more than making up for this was the dense oatmeal cake muffin - something like a no-bake oatmeal bar meets oatmeal cookie meets German chocolate cake - and the ""Sinfully Good Cookie"" that matched dark chocolate with sea salt, brown butter, and Captain Crunch to form something sweet and salty, crunchy and chewy, and quite large for only $1.95.  A cute shop, though the exterior signage could certainly use work, it isn't quite La Grande Orange, Scratch, or Essence but Bertha's is still very good and with a few truly standout items I certainly need to make a return visit to further investigate.",2DUdvdQE8FOxCHHp59HHzw,4,5/26/2013,4,review,3,Eastside,Panda Express

60133,11,lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,mCJnRtbMhNb0BDp5UlRV1A,"Bazaar Meat is one of those restaurants that had me do a double take after a much improved second visit.  My first dinner here was a large group dinner where we split a pig, steak, and many sides between 9 people.  I felt that the pig and steaks were expensive and did not offer a significant value at the price point; it was a three star experience for me.  I hesitated to return, but I'm glad I did.  For my second visit here a friend and I opted to only order small dishes and appetizers; I highly suggest going this route.  The dishes are perfect for two to three people to share, and you get to experience the creativity in the rest of the menu.

Repeats Eats:
Cotton Candy Foie Gras - A small, one bite treat.  As the cotton candy and sugar dissolve, it slowly exposes the savory foie inside.
The Classic Tartare - Delicious.  The best tartare I've had.
The Foieffle - Super rich.  It's good, but even with splitting it in half, I'd be okay with an even smaller portion.  I can't imagine eating this by myself.
Fried Oxtail Steamed Bun - Very decadent, and very juicy.  I'd eat a whole one by myself.  Small but worth the price.
Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega - Very tender pieces of octopus served with potatoes.  
Fresh Sea Urchin - Uni, iberico lardo, served on toasted bread.  Great for sharing.
Wagyu Beef Cheeks - Incredibly tender, bold flavors, made me not want to share

Eh:
Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron - It's neat because it's big.  It's a stronger flavored chicharron.
Suckling Pig - Dry and lacking in flavor.  Portions were tender, but tended to be the exception.
Beef Rib Steak - I think we had the Michima Reserve? Good, but expensive, steak.  I didn't feel like the value was there.
Braised Lamb Neck - Not bad, but forgettable.
Tortilla Sacromonte - An omelet with all sorts of animal parts.  I liked the idea, but the execution was just okay for me.
Robuchon Potatoes - It's like eating a bowl of butter.  That can be a good or a bad things, depending on the person eating said bowl of butter.

Overall there are some definite hits in the small dishes portions of the menu, and I really look forward to returning for them.  However, if you're looking to come here for the pig or the steak, I'd recommend supplementing your meal with lots of small dishes instead of only ordering the meats.

Final note: You should probably rethink your menu design if it weighs more than a pound, is larger than a Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza, and requires a screwdriver and an Allen key to assemble.  Seriously, the poor hosts should get a commission every time they have to seat a table of three or more, because those menus present a potential workers comp claim.",ahSFUPojs9X3-1jP-QPb-w,4,3/5/2015,15,review,16,Southeast,Fracos & Froccs

the space is ok - nothing really stood out. Place was EMPTY. 

Believe it or not, the person flipping the bill insisted we go in case Ms. Longoria was there so he can make a move ...yeah...good luck ! 

pre-meal cocktail was a boring glass of sauvignon blanc. I order that whenever i ask the bartender for his /her recommendation of any of their specialty drinks ( w/o looking at the drink menu ) and if they say i make anything, i go with wine - take some pride in your drinks bartender ! You must have a few specialty cocktails - better yet, one you've created ! 

we order Eva's guacamole ( $12 ???) , a crab cake ( $18 ) - three of us eating. 
i go with the skirt steak ( $29 ) and sides of asparagus and mushrooms ( i believe both were either $8 or $9 ) 
finish the meal with pineapple upside down cake ( damn - when freeloading, i don't pay close attention to price ! I think around $10 ) 

my thoughts ? 

Guacamole - BORING ! Worse, i'm sure it was pre-made then placed in a fridge for god only  knows how long - the guac was waaay too cold. 

Crab cake - decent . It ain't $18 decent but decent all the same. 

Skirt steak - i thought the menu said chili-rubbed. It may have been then it was slathered with bbq styled sauce. It actually had good flavor and the meat was tender. This was the cheapest steak on the menu - price didn't really matter to me, but it sounded interesting. 

The asparagus and mushrooms ...BORING ! 

Can't remember the wine - it was a cab - told it cost about $100 - ok but so memorable i don't know the name of it. 

The pineapple upside down ? i liked the concept - they bring out the cake in the mini- pan and serve it table side with a dollop of ice cream. Had nice flavor but my only gripe - MORE PINEAPPLE PLEASE ! 

Would i hit Beso on my dime in the future ? NO

The interior itself felt like a museum with all the paintings on the walls and the stuffed animal heads (the latter was probably not necessary). One annoying thing was the slow speed at which we were attended to--we had to wait quite a bit before getting our waters, before getting our orders taken, the bread coming out, and then finally each of the fixed courses. 

The bread and clam chowder first course were fine--pretty tasty, nothing to write home about. The second course got interesting. We each ordered a dry aged sirloin, which came with a good salad on the side. The steak was actually done wonderfully, super tender and finely spiced around. But the problem was that both of ours came out rare when we ordered medium-rare! Even our waiter acknowledged this, although by the time he came back around we waited so long that we were pretty much finished with our meal.

I was jonesing for an omelet on Monday so we drove down to the Strip hoping to get breakfast only to be greeted by a line of 35 or more people. Normally I would have waited but It was way too damn hot to stand outside on this particular day. So we drove to Squirrel Hill since we were going to the movies afterwards anyway. My husband remembered that Smallman Street Deli had breakfast.

There was ZERO wait in the place, which I was happy to see. I ordered an omelet with mushrooms, cheese, and bacon. Husband got the crunchy French toast. My meal was excellent. A hearty sized omelet, well-seasoned and lots of filling. The home fries are made from red skin potatoes and well-seasoned where most places just give you plain potatoes with no salt or anything. Very tasty. Mr.'s French toast was sweet, hearty, and had a satisfying crunchy coating. I was a little put off by the packets of Smucker's syrup though...they could spring for some syrup in a pourer or at least a bottle.

I like the service setup...you order at the counter, they bring your food, you get your own drinks. It's low-key and you don't have to worry about waiting around for a server to refill your beverage or being rushed out the door.

So like I said, eff Deluca's and their long lines. This place was just as delicious, if not more so, the prices are about the same, and there was no wait, so this is my new breakfast place.",dW79jPJVpzlTKGF-1JAsaw,5,7/6/2010,1,review,1,Chinatown,Urban Crawfish Station

The food was ... well, it was Grand Lux. It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't anything that you would remember or even think about a day later. Also, since the portions are unnecessarily huge (and, I assure you, you are paying for every ounce of it), we had leftovers so we jokingly asked the waiter if we could put it in the Grand Lux fridge. He said sure and that we could come back and get it later. Total fake-out.

We came back the next day and asked a different waiter for our food. He looked confused and told us that wasn't allowed at all (health violation?). So, I ask, First Waiter, why would you trick a bunch of tourists with promises of potential leftovers? That's just wrong. And mean. And I don't like Grand Lux. Go eat at a buffet.

Living in the Bay Area and Central Valley, the Bouchon in Yountville is only a 40 min drive away either direction. Their bakery carries the most flakiest croissants I've ever had in my life. It's like perfection in my mouth. So when I saw that they carried it at Bouchon ala The Venetian, you know that's what I had to have! Better yet, it came in a chocolate form! OMG! 

To be honest, that was the most memorable thing about Bouchon brunch at the Venetian. They recommended a roast chicken and waffles. Call me a snob but I like my chicken and waffles one way and that's greasy and fried from a place called Roscoes in LA. Anything else, no thanks. I opted though to have an omelet because that morning I just had a hunkering for it. DISAPPOINTED! Probably the most uninspired omelet I've ever had in fact.  And although the service was superb complete with like 3 sets of waiters and servers per table (maybe slightly exaggerated).  It's a nice try to cover up a plain omelet with tomatoes, ham, and I think it was pepper bits. It was bland and I think, sadly, I could have done it at home.

Casual and comfy.  I ordered the ""light"" tilapia with steamed veggies and brown rice: nothing spectacular, but I wanted a light meal and was craving some fish.  My husband had the chicken crepes, which were heavy and ""too creamy.""  He also thought that the salad came with too much dressing.  Our dining companions all had the French onion soup and various accompaniments (fries, sliders, salad).

Not sure what was ""French"" about most of the menu....""French fries"" and ""French onion soup"" isn't ""French.""  To me, anyway....

Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  Nice gal.

Mimi's won't be a go-to spot for me, as I like my restaurants to have that bit of pizzazz and spice, both literally and figuratively.

CONS: Even more then Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible could fix.

1-AMBIANCE: Feels like dining in a not especially clean gasoline station; very uncomfortable hard chairs and bench seating; entering through the secondary entrance provides a full view directly into the dishwashing room; even on a slow Monday night valet parking is mandatory, no self-park option.
1-SERVICE: Slow and disorganized; food delivered to the table piecemeal; understaffed, our server who even prepared the table side guacamole tried his best, but being the only bartender on duty spent the majority of his time also mixing margaritas for the entire restaurant.
1-FOOD: Guacamole was one small avocado chopped with unidentified and unidentifiable ingredients served with flavorless corn chips; chile queso was a large glutinous mass so gummy as to be impossible to penetrate with the aforementioned chips; steak and eggs were a messy plate of food served with tater-tot-like potatoes instead of the advertised bolillo toast; inedible chile Costeno delivered with unmelted cheese and colder then room temperature.
1-VALUE: Least expensive margarita ( a small pour) for $7; guacamole $10.75; chile relleno for  $22; save your money and eat better food at Taco Bell.
1-OVERALL: Considering all the hype, not to mention the high prices, we should have received so much more; a huge disappointment.

Nosh & Swig is a fusion tapas restaurant with some tasty dishes and fun food combinations.  The food is creative and the kitchen sends out dishes plated in imaginative designs on the plate.  Between the plating of the food and the inventive flavor combinations, Nosh & Swig is a place where you're encouraged to play with your food.

We ordered a few meat plates and each was expertly-prepared, creatively plated, and fun.  The Nachos O'Brien consists of peppered pork on potato chips with stewed tomatoes in a creamy bechamel cheese sauce.  The flavors of the meat and cheese sauce were surprisingly well-balanced.  The potato chips were prepared by the kitchen and the fried flavor might have been too strong, but the peppered pork stands strong and the cheese sauce blends the whole dish.  The kitchen also did a great job with the short ribs plate--the ribs were glazed with Dr. Pepper.  The glaze was sweet and thick on the expertly-prepared, tender beef, which is served on amazingly sweet, crisp polenta cornbread and candied carrots.  The candied carrots were a bit much, but everything else was brilliant.

The non-meat dishes were similarly imaginative.  The salmon skewers came cleverly prepared in a miso sweet glaze, making the fish taste almost honeyed.  The kitchen added a fresh seaweed salad that was an excellent compliment to the dish.  

Our favorite dish on the menu was the Elote plate--corn covered in a sauce of garlic butter, cayenne and cilantro.  Wonderful combination--creamy and tart.  The dish is messy, but who cares.  The sauce mixes exceptionally well with the fresh corn underneath. 

Measuring the plates on their own, I think I'd only re-order the Elote, but that doesn't mean I didn't love Nosh & Swig.  The other three dishes we had were clever and fun to experience.  So much that I want to head back and try several more dishes.

Note on the newer-status of the restaurant: Right now, the restaurant seems a little awkward.  The space is designed to be sleek and cosmopolitan--metal tables and comfy booths with small bookcases on the wall including books and busts.  They're not filling up the restaurant yet, so the space feels a little empty, but its more than compensated for by a staff that's working hard to make sure the customers are satisfied.",C-u6Ywuq192icOblKm6oKg,4,1/7/2013,6,review,4,The Strip,The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar

Having not eaten the whole day due to interviews and such, I was starving for good, satisfying food. As my feet hurt from walking around so much and I was already staying in TI, I opted with a few friends to go to Pho, since it was in TI. 

I ordered the beef soup. It came out.. and it was very... meh. The broth was not the greatest.. there was barely any meat.. and just overall, the 12-13 dollar  bowl of Pho was not worth its money. I've had better for $4 in Philly.... but I was pretty disappointed. At the time, I didn't care, since I was so hungry, but looking back.. it wasn't so great.

And on top of that, service was absolutely horrible. It took us 20 minutes to get in.. only to get seated and neglected. We had this older lady who seemed to forget about us. She finally took our order, 30 minutes later, being rude to one of my friends in the process of asking how we were going to pay our bill.

This place is just mediocre. I've eaten homemade pizzas, frozen pizzas and food court pizzas that have tasted better. Leave it to the cunning Mr. Fox to create a seen and be seen, trendy, fast food pizza joint in disguise located in Scottsdale. Go figure. 

I'm not saying Sauce is awful but it's definitely not a place that I want to go back to. The pizza (actually just the food in general) was disappointing. Especially the pizza, as the crust was more like a crispy, greasy cracker sprinkled with parmesan cheese. 

There are two reasons why I gave Sauce three stars instead of two. Number one is because I really liked their Sangria. For $5 I got a huge glass that was very delicious and strong. Number 2 is that I really like the concept. Fast, cheap pizzas and salads are all great things! However, these things are not great when they just taste OK.

Let's start from the beginning. Our party of four was crammed at a tiny table with tons of foot traffic. Some girl came over to take our order... not sure who she was, as she made it a point to tell us she was NOT our server but was going to be taking our order. Clearly she wasn't happy at being told to help out our actual server, as she was rude, surly, uninterested and completely unhelpful. 

When ordering, I said to her, ""How are the short rib enchiladas?"" I got a blank stare and she replied, ""they're good"" in such a way that I began to question my order and said, ""I'm not hearing any enthusiasm... should I order something else?"" She robotically replied with a sigh and said that she's never had them, but they are popular there. Um ok. 

Then, my friend who is a vegetarian, was told by the people at the front that almost everything on the menu could be modified into a vegetarian dish. (I mean, it's really not that difficult. Take any freaking dish and omit the meat and voila!) Rude girl taking our order: ""WHO told you that?!!"" and rolled her eyes and put her hands defiantly on her hips. Then she added, ""The ONLY vegetarian options are a cheese quesadilla or a salad!"" After being told what was said at the front, my friend asked if she could order cheese enchiladas with avocado and was told ""Oh, I guess you could do that."" When our food came, no cheese enchiladas... but instead, a cheese quesadilla. ((SIGH)). The food runner was just as rude. My friend made the comment that it wasn't what she ordered but she'd eat it anyway. The runner insisted on getting the enchiladas as she barked, ""BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY!"" Lol.

And during the long period of time we were waiting for our food, I flagged down a server and asked for some chips and salsa. And as if this place didn't suck already, I was told they CHARGE for chips and salsa! What?!! Come again?? Never, ever in my life have I been to a Mexican restaurant (and I've been in a LOT in my time) and been charged for chips and salsa. I mean, I know we are in the price gouging capital of the world, Las Vegas, where dumb tourists will fork out any kind of money not knowing any better, but it will be a cold day in hell before I pay $5 bucks for chips and salsa. One week later, I'm still shaking my head as I write this.

Other than that, we never saw our server again... never checked on us, refilled water, nothing. The food was unremarkable. Average, at best. The mango picante margarita was pretty decent... took forever to arrive but tasted good. I was about 85% thru my meal when someone over my shoulder tried to take my plate away (wtf).

I have, however, had several sushi rolls from this place. I typically build my own (the white tuna or the salmon) because, why not? Where else am I going to find tasty sushi for $8? You can choose 2 veggies, the kind of paper you want it wrapped in, a sauce, and a topping. The yum yum sauce is (so far) my favorite. It is creamy (probably mayo-based) sauce that's rather savory. 

The only ""designer"" roll that I've had is the Ohio Roll. It is deep-fried after it is assembled and the temperature threw me off. I am not saying it was bad, because it wasn't, but I couldn't get over warm sushi.

So when he said he wanted to eat at Tofu Hut, my first thought was, ""tofu? seriously?"" But don't let the name fool you, Tofu Hut is a Korean BBQ restaurant. They offer a regular menu or a cook-it-yourself, all-you-can-eat BBQ menu ($16.99 10am to 11pm & only $13.99 11pm to 4am). We chose the all-you-can-eat (of course).

Once we were seated at one the built-in grill tables, we ordered the sliced ribeye, short rib, brisket & pork belly (there are other meats like chicken, tripe & beef tongue). The meats were quickly brought out on platters, portioned enough to cover the entire grill. All of the meats were good & the sliced ribeye was super tender & really flavorful.

An assortment of side dishes were brought to our table. Rice, salad, kimchee, bean sprouts, pickled cucumber & a bunch of other stuff that I don't know the names of. Everything was tasty & the salad - shredded cabbage & lettuce, more like cole slaw, but with a sweet Korean spiced dressing that made this a favorite. The only dipping sauce we got for the meat was an olive oil with salt & pepper, but it was good. 

The servers frequently asked if we needed anything, so I can't complain about the service. The restaurant is small enough that you can flag one of the servers down, or just look toward the counter and get their attention, if you need anything. It's all you can eat, so just ask for more. 

Overall, the food is really good, prices are reasonable, restaurant is clean & our group of 10 was easily accommodated. This is a fun & interesting place to bring a group of hungry people. Although we did go back to our hotel smelling like kalbi, we'll surely be eating here on our future visits to Las Vegas.",0w3BdEOxvwKTpypwbN5kiQ,4,12/30/2010,5,review,4,Westside,Mamma's Boy Cafe

I had the two meat plate with pulled pork, 2 ribs, and slaw. The best thing was the slaw, very creamy, loved it, devoured it. 

The pulled pork is not bad. Served with sauce on the side (which I really appreciate), the texture is more like chopped meat than pulled, stringy pork. But it was pleasantly chewy, good smoke flavor, a bit bland with no sauce at all, but just a little sauce made it pretty darn good. (I usually avoid sauce, I'm a dry rub guy in most situations.) This sauce was very good though. Nice balance of tanginess and sweetness (most BBQ sauces are too sweet, in my opinion.) 

Ribs were okay. Just two in this combo, and they're not big or especially meaty. You get more than twice as much pulled pork as you get rib meat. There could be a more generous spice rub on the ribs for my tastes, or they could have shakers of spice rub on the table. Meat texture was pretty good, on the dry, flaky side, which I consider proper with BBQ ribs. Clearly they have *not* been steamed or braised, just smoked. That's all good. Were they great ribs? I have to say no. But the place is still pretty new, and these things take time to get dialed in.  Ribs get a 6 out of 10. 

I'll give them another try soon. Several other meats to try, and plenty of sides. 

Service was friendly and efficient. Value for money was not bad, I'd say excellent if they just made it 3 ribs instead of 2 on the combo plate.",6B-sZzuNYnVz5sk2c4EfHA,4,4/15/2016,0,review,0,Eastside,Subway

This first round of sushi that we ordered, was... decent, maybe 3 stars, however when we ordered more sushi the fish was visibly lower quality fish (especially the albacore nigiri). I tried it anyway, knowing sometimes I can be picky about the way things look, and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I've never tasted such disgusting fish. My hubby even had to take one of his rolls apart because the fish on top wasn't fresh. The gyoza was awful. I think the best thing we got was the green salad with soggy tomatoes. 

In addition, this place is full of rules. They have a time limit of 45 minutes for their all you can eat menu - which is stressful and annoying when you are paying so much. Then, when you don't finish your CRAPPY meal, they have the nerve to charge you for the leftovers. 

And last but not least, Sushi Mon also gets one star less for decor - they had pieces of paper all over the walls with items you can order put up with scotch tape. I'm not super picky about decor, but it does matter some to me... SO NOT MY PLACE.

They said it was a GREAT spot, and they were right!  I couldn't believe the price, $1 for a nigiri piece, $3 for a standard tuna roll or spicy tuna (8 piece).  It's mostly a take-out spot and does not offer much in the way of decor, but when I can get an entire sushi meal for $10.81 (haha, I go way too much), who cares?

Their fish is always fresh and the size of the pieces are just fine, especially for $1.  You can't complain.  I'm here 2x's a week on average and completely hooked.  I usually call on my way home, place my order, pick up, and go home to enjoy.  They now even have Tamari wheat-free soy sauce!  (on request)

They have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7.  They also serve a sort of Vietnamese-Chinese fusion menu with spring rolls, Pho, stir-fry, etc...  I haven't tried anything there except for the sushi, but people seem to enjoy it.

I highly recommend this place.  Again, go for the food, not the atmosphere.  The sushi chef, John, is very cool too.  Nice guy and very personable.  Makes you feel at home.",8UH1z6wfAwpax4o1slD9EA,5,2/26/2008,4,review,4,Westside,Love Empanadas

There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.

The chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.

I ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.

On a Sunday night, my friends and I attempted to find quality Italian food and found the Bootlegger Bistro sitting in a loud corner of not much else. The atmosphere was dark and the music all over the place. At one point they started to play 90's rock after getting tired of playing the same jazz hit 5 times in an hour. The service was lacking. The waitress seemed to have forgotten us much of the time and sitting there, we distinctly thought we could smell a waft of the good old ganja. She seemed really happy anyway...

Vic called for the Bootlegger Hot Mixed Antipasti. Bland. The Toasted Ravioli might as well have been slightly stale pasta flavored Playdough with very basic marinara used for everything that night. The House Specialty Shrimp wasn't exactly special. Though the calamari was not bad. Not over cooked and normal enough to be edible.

I ordered Manicotti Infornati because I love ricotta wrapped in pasta and served with marinara, but I found that the ricotta was underwhelming and the marinara was lacking in herbs. My main course was overall a thorough disappointment considering that the plates were priced a little heavier than I like. (I like inexpensive. Inexpensive is the joy of students). 

We waffled back and forth on dessert and in the end, we succumbed to our dark love of sweets. One was a Cannoli that had a strong taste of orange liqueur. Maybe Grand Marnier. The liqueur taste was strong, but for once, I was pleased and even infatuated with it. But that's if you're an orange flavor lover like me. The moment of sheer beauty and bliss however, was our Tiramisu. Absolutely fantastic and the reason why this restaurant has 3 stars. There was a distinct flavor of alcohol, but it was superbly balanced with the sweetness and that richness that is Tiramisu. It was in a word: transcendent. I have never found Tiramisu to be an appealing dessert till now, but every time I near Vegas, that will be one of the highlights of all my trips. The Tiramisu.

It's actually 2.5 for the price range.

We've gone 6 or 7 times in total hoping that it will live up to it's name and we've been disappointed every time. From servers not refilling coffee, incorrect orders, undercooked food, having to ask for our check at the cashier because our server disappeared after serving the food it seems there are always issues.

I ordered the veggie pizza which might very well be the best veggie pizza I've ever had. The crust was soft yet crunchy on the bottom. The grilled veggies on top were amazing. All the flavors were amazing on the pizza. I think it was only $13. I had like 4 slices to take home after eating 4 in the restaurant. 

We went back a second time and got mashed potato stuff eggrolls for appetizer. They were pretty good but they needed something more. Maybe the bacon since we ordered it without. I was craving asian food and got the zen noodles thinking it was a stir fry. Turned out to be a makeshift version of pho. Not good. A miss with that one. But I'm still stuck on the amazing pizza so I forgive them for the noodles. My bf ate a burger which he said was really good.

Starting the night off by walking in through the kitchen always reminds me of GoodFellas, and that's a good thing.  I happen to like the old school signage / decor, it adds character to a restaurant that has been in the same spot for 60+ years.  

They were busy, so it took a while to get drink / appetizer orders, but it wasn't unreasonable.  The only appetizer we got was the spinach-artichoke dip, and it was one of the best I've had.  My wife, my muse, got the wedge salad and it was fresh and also delicious.  I shared the 48 oz. porterhouse with my friend, and let me say that when a hunk of meat that big comes to the table you have to just appreciate the art that it takes to cook it so perfectly.  We got the mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin on the side, which were ideal compliments.  

After getting the rest of what we couldn't finish to go, the waiter recommended the strawberry shortcake.  We were all full, but the four of us split - and was quite possibly one of the finest and tastiest desserts ever.

Palms ""Prime Bites"" Happy Hour has been on my list for a long while. You can't beat $3.50 apps! Just a note- it's in the bar area only. 

I tried:

 Filet Mignon Capri Sandwiches, comes w/ 3- it was okay. The components are very fresh, but the bread got soggy fast with the fresh mozzarella sitting on it. I pulled out the ingredients and that some quality caprese. 

Mini Broiled Crab cakes, comes w/3- pretty decent. It comes on top of a water cracker and comes with mango salsa and a tartar sauce. It had decent lumps of crab in it instead of pulverized minced.

""Point Judith"" Calamari Fritti- can't go wrong with calamari, but it's not the best version I had. It needed a little bit more seasoning or a more flavorful dip than the tomato sauce. 

Oysters on a half shell ($1 a shell)- lovely, very fresh. Don't know the variety, but these had a nice briny flavor to them. Horseradish was pretty mean which made me a happy oyster (eater). 

Drinks aren't part of happy hour, but I tried the 

Black Widow ($12) ""Muddled fresh mint, raspberries and handsqueezed lime juice, with Belvedere Black Raspberry Vodka, topped with Chandon Brut Classic, served up.""- It was good, but did not grasp a hint of mint in there. I could tell the alcohols and tasted mostly the fresh raspberries swimming in my glass. 

( Sorry, no pics...it was too dark for my phone to catch) 

Bar staff is friendly and attentive. They seem to enjoy their job and like to chat. They make sure to check on everyone periodically and did well considering the bar did not have a empty seat.

Burger was delivered used down in half and the burger itself looked good but did not deliver on taste. this could be because it was takeout, so not too hot (although it is 5 blocks from my hotel so not a long ride). Fries were over salted, nice truffle flavor but again, seemed to have been made much earlier.  The wedge was the most disappointing because i was looking forward to what is described as wedge with blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon  Got the iceberg lettuce and some bacon but no blue cheese.

It's definitely not anything mindblowing, or especially innovative but it's uniquely Pittsburgh and it's got all the carbs and meat you need if you're hungry/hungover/drunk.

You can also pay a bit more for double meat or an egg and you can ask for onions for free. Getting an egg on the sandwich is fantastic. You can also ask them to remove the cole slaw or the fries or have them on the side instead if that's not your thing. 

This place is pretty close to both CMU and Pitt and there's a ton of bars and other restaurants in the area too so it's nicely situated and a ton of students end up going here. They also have beers on tap and it gets really dive-y on weekend evenings.

The food is still pretty good but not nearly as amazing as it used to be.  The customer service is now completely subpar. The waitress didn't write down our group's large order then brought us the wrong food. Said she wouldn't charge us for the incorrect dishes that she left at the table and then later when they were still on our bill she  had the nerve to say ""well you ate them didn't you?"" We were there for almost two hours and the only way to get her to our table was to ask another server to send her over. When she came over she was rude. The manager came by to ask how the night was going and when we reluctantly told him (we were trying to enjoy our night and not dwell on the negative), he was kind and offered us a round of drinks. But after he visited our table somehow the service got worse instead of better. It was certainly very nice to buy us drinks but I would have preferred to have the problem corrected. This is actually not the first time I've had a rude server there. When I looked around that evening, the tables around us seemed frustrated as the wrong food was constantly being delivered to their tables.

Yeah, wing special starts at 4. hmmm. Ok, decided on poppers and a slice of cheese pizza.  The poppers were jalapeno and cream cheese (which I despise!) but the menu didn't specify and I failed to ask. They also were soft, so I think they were baked. AWFUL!   The pizza was ok- not great, but satisfied my hunger. The server asked if he could box up the rest of my poppers (I only ate 3/6) and I said no, that I didn't like them and I don't like cream cheese- I prefer cheddar. He acted totally surprised, but of course charged me full price. Whatever- I'm sure their other food is good, but I was just so turned off by the poppers and the whole ""specials start at 4"" bit that I have no desire to go back.

However saying that, I've worked with people who are just not cut out to be in the service industry. It's not for everyone. Every restaurant I've worked in as a server, you're expected to know the cocktails and foods that are offered, at minimum. So when it took our server 15 minutes to actually greet us and take our beverage order I thought ordering a margarita was pretty basic. So another 15 minutes when pink drinks were being dropped off at the table I was slightly confused where I was informed that they were the ""platinum margaritas"" that we had ordered. Weird, I remember ordering a margarita and asking what tequila was used (the server couldn't answer that so I said well was fine) but not a platinum margarita. Upon sending it back I noticed on the menu that the platinum was significantly more expensive (which I wouldn't mind paying for, if that was actually what I wanted in the first place) and it came with my choice of chambord or grand marinier in terms of a cadillac margarita. Hmmmm... so instead of asking which we preferred she automatically put in chambord while upselling us without our permission. Shady. Fast forward to 30 minutes and four trips to the table later. I have successfully had to explain to our server what chambord is, what grand marnier is, and what a cadillac margarita is. (They don't teach these things in training?!) The manager had to stop by the table because after the fifth time when the server couldn't get a request right as simple as extra salt on a margarita for my friend, we have just had it. 45 minutes to get a simple margarita order right is completely unacceptable. I'm sorry to say this, but this has to be hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I didn't even try the food because the service was so incompetent.

I would imagine that a lunch rush would fill this establishment up quickly.  However, I noticed a majority of orders where being called in and consumed elsewhere.

I checked out the menu on the wall and settled on the Maui Rose House Chicken.  It came with Miso soup and a salad.  In addition to the meal I ordered up a Spam Musubi.  There was no soda fountain so I settled on a can of Coke.

We took advantage of the Yelp Check-in offer of free salsa and chips. They brought us two types of ""colored"" chips and salsa (hot & medium). 

We ordered the VEGAN NACHOS. If your expecting nacho cheese sauce. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's basically chips placed on a hot skillet they topped with Crumbles of veggie patty, Daiya cheese, beans, corn, sautéed peppers and onions, guacamole and a small amount of green salsa. This nacho was DRY as hell! It seemed like they put everything together and then slapped it into the oven. The nachos stick together. Making it hard to pull apart.

Just when I thought the Nacho was dry. I was ""served"" the Driest Tex-Mex Burrito. Is there a shortage in sauce? I won't go into detail with it because no amount of sauce can make this taste good. It's like eating dry rice and beans. The sad thing is both Burrito and Nachos are not cheap. 

I did think the massive Bloody Mary bar was cool. Other than that I don't think I would come back unless my honey begs me to. Then maybe just maybe, I'll give in!",vjhB95c5nOXflNoyq_jKzw,2,10/29/2014,8,review,8,Westside,Rika Arepa Express

Entering the restaurant, it was clear it was high end, no mere ""Ra Sushi"" experience. For the most part everyone was pleasant. Our server however was another story. 

But onto the food. Pretty much the best sushi I've had in town. The sashimi was fresh and succulent. The appetizers (beef tataki, scallops) were unique and very well prepared, and the tempura was lightly battered -- probably how it always should be done. My parents and I really liked the food, and yes, it is more expensive than your typical sushi place.

Back to our server. As he introduced himself he boasted that this is the best food and the best service in town. As we were pondering wine selections he offered that they had a special Bordeaux-like wine that would go great with the steak selections. We eventually asked how much it was and he volunteered it was around $100. I said that might be a little rich and asked if they had something full-bodied from their normal (sub-$50) list. He replied that we couldn't get anything full-bodied unless we approached $100. As the ordering process continued, he tried to up-sell us along the way. At the end he confirmed to himself that it was the best food and the best service. 

I'll probably be back but need to shake off this best service experience...

The food is NOT authentic Indian food. The server even told us when we were sat that it is Americanized Indian food. It is definitely an interpretation. (There was cilantro in my dish...) But as long as you have that understanding before you go, you should be fine.

They had an interesting selection of beer and wine. Unfortunately my husband did not care for his IPA and I didn't love my glass of Pinot Grigio. Luckily, the drinks were the only thing we disliked...

I ordered the mixed veggies entree with spinach sauce. Since the server told me it was Americanized Indian food, I was worried it wouldn't be spicy and I love a little heat. You are able to customize the spice level, thank God, so I ordered it medium. I thought the plating was attractive and enticing. And the food was yummy... Not swimming in ghee so it goes down smoothly. There was a delicious smoky grilled taste to the food that I loved. I wish it came with more naan. The naan was delicious too. Nice and crispy and garlicky. You can definitely taste the olive oil in the food which I wasn't expected to like. 

My husband had the chicken biryani. He loved it. The portions are enormous, so I had plenty of food leftover for a yummy lunch the next day.

Literally next door to each. Well sort of.  I have passed this spot a few times, but had no idea it was the same as the fancy bakery with the chocolate fountain.

My guess is this place is slightly busier than the Bellagio location. I was told there was a 45 minute wait for a crepe. Considering there were only a few people ahead of me in line, my only guess is that the other guests who ordered crepes were patiently waiting at a table or some d-bag in front me ordered for himself and 20 of his closest friends. Either way, I ended up with a sandwich, the rose macaroon, and a strawberry lemon cupcake. Total $25.

Roast Beef Sandwich: Looks like it should be hot, but it's not. Despite that, it was actually pretty freakin' delicious. Maybe I'm biased, but the bread was soft and I love roast beef and horseradish. It was a pretty good size, still overpriced at $11. My guess is that it was made with extra love.

Rose Macaroon: I have an aversion for anything that sounds like it'll taste like flowers. But my nephew said that looks good, and you only live once. It wasn't too flowery. I'm a sucker for macaroons, but I think regular sized versions are better. Purely for convenience.

Strawberry Lemon cupcake: + 10 points for looking like the a cupcake from the future. +10 points for not disappointing in the flavor department (not too much lemon, not too much strawberry, not too sweet). + 5 because a spoon required (which sounds like it should be minus points, but I actually prefer cake in an actual cup and using a spoon.

And to further confuse things, the staff refers to everything and everywhere in the restaurant as 'flavortown' - clearly a Guy catch phrase.  You'll also notice that the staff nearly makes a poor Guy impression through your stay, giving that 'hey, I'm cool and relaxed and this place is HIP' vibe - only it's not genuine at all.  How neurotic is Guy that he imposes his personality on the staff?... 

The food is actually quite pleasant! We had two of the Mexican infused burgers and the guac, it was truly great.  I would eat it again and recommend!  The only downside to the food are the chips - they're stale, hard, and flavorless.  If I didn't need a vessel for the delicious guac, I would have avoided them at all costs.

The wait staff was somewhat of a toss up here.  Our waiter was Ok, they were speedy and stayed on top of things.  

However, the management is clueless.  During our entire meal, the general manager and bar manager hosted a vendor (Shane) who was selling a drink infusing gimmick so they could start making Mules at the bar- he was loud, right next to us and we couldn't even hold a conversation.  The bar manager even asked how we were at one point - when we pointed it out she responded with ""oh cool, yeah we're trying to make Mules"" - hardly the appropriate response to a complaint.  You'd think they would do business deals and host sales events outside of operating hours.

I don't know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  ""No Probably"" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   

                                  Eight Items on the Buffet 

Fried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork


As I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: ""How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right""?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. 

So there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!",LjCrhp_Rys2bCIJHz5EGBA,1,5/22/2013,5,review,4,Downtown,Cafe Heidelberg German Market & Restaurant

Their sandwiches are around $9 while entrees are closer to $18. The pork belly panini was out of this world as was the spicy feta dip. Other members of our party ordered the gyro, salmon, and trout. All were pleased. Sandwiches come with a side of fingerling potatoes, which were lacking a bit of flavor but were cooked well. 

I tried the goat's breast milk. It was described as creamy, but tasted like a spritzy mojito. I was disappointed, so I opted for a glass of Chardonnay instead.

First it was a pretty cruddy looking place to eat. 1960's tables, out of place paintings and horrible lighting.

2nd They had pop and alcohol nothing kid centered like milk or juice (they did have tomatoe juice) these first two were signs, just small things.

3rd my coke was mainly carbonated water. Being in the Christmas spirit I didn't want to complain I just ordered a separate sprite. That sprite barely had any syrup in it just nasty seltzer water. 

By this time I wanted to pay for the drinks and leave but the wife talked me into staying. 

4th the food was generic, not bad just no different than the foodcourt at the old mall.  

5th we had no assigned waitress just a young girl an older woman and a man all interchangeing jobs. The man brought us our food. My wife and I ate quickly as it wasn't comfortable and we wanted to leave. As I was chewing the guy asked if we needed boxes ""no that's ok"" then he asked if we were done. Obviously my daughter wasn't and I was chewing. So by that I thought he meant do we want the check. I said yes and he took all our plates. .. still food on all of them and my daughter and I were even chewing. 

Well they have is the $ 50 check (for general tsos, honey chicken,  and a side of rice and lo mien).

Don't get me wrong it was not a bad meal by any means, but it wasn't worth the price ($165 per person without tax/tip) and I feel it doesn't match up near the meal I had at Kabuto. None of the dishes made me ""wow"" or left any sort of impression on me. I honestly cannot recall any dish that I'd recommend.

Being a nice French restaurant located right on the edge of one of the Venetian's pools, I was expecting much more from Bouchon. We were very promptly seated on the patio after being asked twice if we were sure we wanted to sit in the heat. We were fine with sitting outside, but being sat almost directly in the sun when there were empty tables still completely shaded was a little bit of a head scratcher. (No biggie, brush it off) A server then brings a glass of orange juice to our table and the girlfriend and I look at each other, confused. Is OJ complimentary at this fine place? Answer: No. OJ was then taken away after our server being made aware. Then comes the C & W fiasco. Oh, Chicken and Waffles, how I so looked forward to devouring you this fine Vegas morning......(Screeching halt) ""C & W is one of our most requested dishes during the week, but our chef likes to serve it as a specialty item on weekends"" was the response from our waiter. So... you tell me how many times daily that $12 is wasted on a cab ride to NOT eat C & W on a weekday? (Yes partially my fault for not doing my research, but c'mon man) Breakfast was just OK, my corn beef hash was served first and started to get cold as we waited about 5 minutes for the girlfriends dish to arrive and her's still wasn't warm?

Seated promptly, nice looking restaurant,  though they didn't have the heat on and it was freezing.. Heeding the warnings of other posters, I specifically asked for no added salt, and while my cassoulet was still on the salty side, it was quite good, my other dining companions had the pot roast, both agreed it was salty. They shouldn't have to hide flavor issues with too much salt. We tried the famous bone marrow appetizer.... wouldn't have that again, basically flavorless - and salty.

The service was not what one would expect for a restaurant in this price range ($140 for 3, with tip, no drinks, no dessert), just mediocre. Someone needs to focus on proper serving for a table. One should not have to ask for basic things like extra water.

My meal itself was good - not ""scream out loud this is the best place I have ever been"" - but good. Would I go back? Probably not simply due to the salt level and the poor service.",JLbgvGM4FXh9zNP4O5ZWjQ,3,11/21/2016,1,review,1,The Strip,Steakhouse 46

On this trip we ordered the clam strips ($5) the waffle fries ($1.95), peel and each shrimp($5) and the portions were good sized and very tasty.

Bazic is probably one of the few karaoke bars I can stand in Las Vegas.  After being dragged to almost every single karaoke venue in town by my friends, the number of mediocre to just plain awful karaoke rooms I've been to has been mind-blowing.  Fortunately, Bazic has six rooms with flat screen TVs, great sound systems, and a good variety of songs.  It almost makes a three-hour karaoke session tolerable.

For those of you who don't give a booty for karaoke, Bazic has some great food as well. During the last few years I've been to Bazic, I only recently tried their food.  I knew for a fact that the fried chicken was their famous dish, but I wanted to try something different.  I looked at their selections and ordered the squid salad instead.  It was actually very good, and tasted almost exactly how it does back at the homeland.  I would say the fried chicken is a ""safe"" order, but if you want to try something a little more experiential, ask the waitress for a recommendation.  My classmate asked about the seafood pancake, the waitress informed her, and she really enjoyed it.

I know Bazic is famous for their fried chicken, but I think there's other great dishes that flies under the radar.

The table is set with fresh Italian bread and Holy Oil with banana peppers.  There is also a smal cheese plate served with chick peas and a goat cheese spread

Appetizer: Mussels in a tomatoe sauce was the best I've ever had. The sauce was amazingly flavorful.

My veal chop was prepared perfectly. 

Worth the price of admission although expensive. We shared an entree and brought our own bottle, yet still managed to drop $110.  Sharing meals is also acceptable there because of portion size. $15 add on that includes an extra salad and side of pasta. 

Only complaint was having dinner in the upstairs bar area where a Lemieux jersey was hanging on the wall. I love Mario, however, this isn't Fatheads.  I suppose the yinzer roots can't be completely ignored. In some ways it's charmingly Pittsburgh.",vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg,5,8/13/2012,2,review,0,Centennial,Mezze Foods

I came on a Sunday for lunch (not even hungry, but really wanted some of this), NO WAIT! I'm not sure if this is normal for them, but the SoCal locations are sooo ridiculous on wait time. I remember trying to go on a rando Wednesday night at 8pm and there was a 1+ hr wait still. 

Food: The quality of the seafood and the flavoring of them are both on point. I really like the clams! Shrimp is good too, except I'm too lazy to peel so not as big of a fan. Crawfish, I'm just ok on that normally, but I always get it because it feels weird to go to a place like this and not. I haven't tried the crab here. Also, a lot of work to eat crab. Gah, I'm just lazy. Clams all day! I will say, everything gets pretty salty after a while. Obviously, since it is heavily seasoned/sauced. 

Prices: I don't remember how much things cost, but I do remember it being pretty reasonable.

The worst part of this restaurant experience is finding it- we walked around the casino for 10 minutes trying to locate it, but after asking 2 employees where it was, we finally found out it was right near the main entrance to the Venetian (which we had entered from 10 minutes prior), tucked away to the right of the check-in desk and up 10 floors in the suites tower. 

Once we got there it was a great experience. I can't say how much of Thomas Keller's influence is on this place (he obviously does not cook there, and we're still planning a FL visit) but if he had any effect whatsoever, it had to have been good. 

The restaurant has a casual yet elegant feel, and the service was impeccable and not in any way obtrusive. That's exactly the service I like- help us out when service is needed, but stay out of the way for the most part. Dishes were promptly cleared, water was filled at just the right intervals, and the pacing of the food was on point. Our waiter was informative but not pushy.

We started off with the parsnip soup and mac and cheese side, which were both excellent. I choose the roasted chicken based on our waiter's recommendation and my gf had the steak and frites (basically a really nice version of steak with fries on top). Her steak was one of the better steaks we've had in a restaurant, and we've had alot. The chicken was tender, moist, with just the right amount of seasoning on the crispy skin. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size, we couldn't make it to dessert because we were so full off of our appetizers/entrees. We probably could have done without even one of the entrees and still would have been full. I actually felt a little sluggish after, but I don't think I'm used to all that butter and cream in my diet.

This particular location is close to where I work. I have ordered from this particular store on several different occasions prior to writing this review, usually on my way to work. Sometimes, it is close to closing time when I get there. However, every single time I go, the customer service is pretty good. I just went there again this evening before coming to work, and about an hour before they close. I guess I have been there enough times where they ask if I want the same thing I ordered last time, and they actually remembered what it was! (Salmon bowl with veggies, brown rice, and spicy teriyaki sauce, for those of you who really want to know) I'm always impressed by things like that. 

I commended them on being aware of my order history like that, but I went with a steak and chicken bowl this time around. However, I still got it with the veggies, brown rice, and spicy teriyaki sauce.

Their food and service is consistent here. At least, when I have gone. And I will continue to be a 1-2 times-per-week visitor. Good, healthier food option, good price, and very good customer service.",JdXWoFcLDxE7OhC63r8zAQ,4,8/16/2016,2,review,1,Summerlin,Red Rock Pizza

I too dined at this great new restaurant last night and experienced the five star service I expect from Chef Kevin Binkley and his staff. Keep in mind, this restaurant has only been open since Wednesday, March 20! 

My friend and I were 15 minutes late for our reservation and still were seated promptly, first on the patio and then when we decided it was a bit too cold they told us we could wait a bit for a table or sit at the bar. We happily sat at the bar where we enjoyed the bartender, Joby as well as the sommelier, Amy Binkley's service. 

After a great wine recommendation, we ordered the beets and the burratta. Both were served in approx. 5 minutes after we ordered. And both were so tasty! We also received a little gift from the Chef, an order of sweet and sour sweetbreads, which were delicious! And not something I would usually order so it was a great treat. 

Next we asked for help choosing between the cauliflower and the broccoli. Joby said to go with the broccoli and he was spot on! Finally, we ordered the risotto and it was the best part of our meal. We wanted seconds, but opted to try a cake doughnut (just one!) before we finished up, paid our tab and headed home. 

The bill for all of that food and a bottle of wine, only $80!!!

My picky style has never resisted me for taking up an opportunity to dine at Pappadeux as they have on shore tasty items on the menu. I always seem to dive into the crispy chicken fingers along with the wide variety of sides, however my last visited I was tempted to try the broiled half chicken. Boy was I impressed. It was so flavorful and fell right off the bone. Not only was it not dry but it was juicy. Matter of fact those seafood eaters who dined with me tasted a sample and wanted to clean my plate. Too bad and so sad for them they will have to come back because I ate it all. Along with the spaghetti squash and a bed of white rice.

We came in, excited, and ready to enjoy. We sat at the table closest to the bar. We ate and drank as any group in their early 30s would. Shared apps, steaks, cocktails. Nothing out of the ordinary. A young woman waited on us, who I will not name. As our time at E&R came to an end, we asked for the check. The bill was placed on the table and was left for us to figure out. We did, over $360 in cash, was put in a pile on the table. We continued to finish our drinks and our plates of food. Moments later, the female server came over and set down another check. One of the guests in our party explained that we paid it already, as she looked for the money. The server insisted we had not paid. The group immediately asked for management. After a brief description of the situation to management, the manager spoke with our server. He then came over to us moments later and brought 3 of us out on the patio, adjacent to the bar. He explained that the server accused one of the members in our party of stealing and he pointed out who the server felt committed this crime. I want to preface the rest of this story by saying, everyone in this party has been friends for more then 10years, minimum. We enjoy holidays together, know one another's family intimately, and have even been in weddings together. I trust everyone from that party implicitly. That being said, we finally called out the accused guest to the patio. We explained the situation and he immediately took off his shoes, coat, shirt, belt, pulled out his pocket. He was one article away from being naked. Imagine the horror? In front of strangers, guests, and friends, being accused of stealing and having to defend yourself in that manner. Everyone else in the party followed suit and we asked the manager to please check the cameras. He explained he could not, only ownership had access to the cameras. Really? What sort of policy is this? Obnoxious.
We politely obliged the managers request for a day to resolve the issue. He then asked us to pay the bill again. The audacity! We did, begrudgingly, as we knew the next day the group would be vindicated and the money returned. Wrong. 
      Over the next week and a half I called the restaurant almost daily. Everyday it was a different excuse as to why they haven't checked the cameras. Either ""The Owner's are working on it"" or ""They are close to a resolution"" or ""The manager you need isn't here"". This team of managers and owners passed the buck and I think it only peaks to their character as adults and people who run a business. Finally, after 15 days, I received an answer. The verdict? The camera was bad and they can't see the angle. It was tough to tell. I implored them to spare my feelings and please tell me if it was one of our diners who committed the crime, so that we could rectify it personally and I could apologize to Echo&Rig. The manager on the other end explained, ""It's not that...."" He would not elaborate. They basically said ""That's it"" No invite back in, no free dessert, no handshake, no sincere apology. They were just glad it was over. I will never set foot in that restaurant again and I suggest you do the same. We paid over $700 for one meal, do to the inept and dishonest nature of the staff, management, and ownership.
     To conclude my review, I will say that, I work in the Food and Beverage sector myself. I work for a renowned chef on the Las Vegas Strip. The rest of the party, also works for either the same chef or others of similar ilk on the strip. We told this story to every person we could in the last few weeks, in order to gauge if our behavior and actions were appropriate. We feel we handled it in the most proper manner. E&R did not. I realize that reviews like this can cost people their jobs, so I do not take a review like this lightly at all. I realize the brevity of a tool such as Yelp. If you are an honest, hardworking, decent person, I believe their are better places to spend your money, right here in our community of Summerlin.",igHYkXZMLAc9UdV5VnR_AA,1,1/17/2014,5,review,0,Westside,Tacos Mexico

My first visit was during lunch time and while service was incredibly slow and they were out of a lot of foods, I very much enjoyed the food. The staff was helpful in answering questions about my dietary restrictions and finding accommodations.

My visit last night was just annoying. I checked Yelp for business hours as I didn't want to drive out of my way, late in the evening just to fulfill a pregnancy craving. Closing on a Friday at 9pm. Cool. I have about 1.5 hours to get there, plenty of time. 

When we get there there are lots of people walking around the restaurant, but they looked like they were cleaning. The sign on one door said Friday hours were 'til 6pm... the sign on the other door said that hours were until 9pm on Friday. The door wasn't locked and was in fact cracked open. So we get out of our vehicle and walked in.

As soon as we opened the door an employee barked 'we're closed.... We close at 8pm on Fridays'. My husband points out the hours painted on the windows and the time listed on yelp. Again, we were barked at 'we're working on fixing that.'

I get the impression from other yelp reviews and now my own experience that employees just kinda make things up as they go. They make their own hours and open/close when they feel like it. 

Recommendation - call before you go to eat... they might have no food and who knows if they'll even be open.",5aeR9KcboZmhDZlFscnYRA,2,6/29/2013,2,review,0,Westside,Sansei Japanese Cuisine

My thoughts:

--the Maryland location is small-ish, so you're in close quarters with everyone.

-- it had a bit of a fishy smell, more so than other sushi joints. I chalked it up to the close quarters of place.

--they were flexible with the AYCE option. At first, we weren't sure whether we wanted to do AYCE. Sometimes it makes more sense, especially if you want to try lots of different rolls.  But you gotta be ready for AYCE, i.e., have some drawstring sweatpants on.

As we debated, the chef advised us that he would tally the amount once we were done, and charge us whatever was less, whether that be itemizing the rolls or the AYCE price. Awesome!!!

--one of the best things I loved is that they let you order half orders of most rolls. This is really great when there's only two people eating. My husband and I have different tastes, so it can be challenging to eat multiple rolls by myself. But we love trying lots of different rolls. Ordering half rolls was a great option for us.

--that being said, I didn't l-o-v-e the rolls. Don't get me wrong -- it was good but I just didn't think it was *great.* Some of the rolls we had were kinda bland. Maybe it was just an off-night we went. I think I'm willing to give it a try again ;-)",7ibuDLfx8gEhESAufYIySw,3,2/14/2011,2,review,1,Eastside,Cilantros Taco Grill

- Stella Artois
- Blue Moon
- Spicy Tuna Roll
- Rock Shrimp w/ Ja Roll
- Shrimp Tempura Roll
- Whitefish Tempura Roll
- Eggplant Tempura Roll
- Albacore Tuna Roll
- Filet Wrapped Asparagus
- Crispy Chicken
- Chocolate Volcano Cake

The sushi was fresh and the tempura was crispy.  The true testament to this place is that my wife, who does NOT each sushi, actually enjoyed most of the sushi!  We both thought the Eggplant Tempura Roll was inventive and as good as any of the traditional rolls.  You'd be wise to skip the Crispy Chicken completely as it was tasteless and dry.  The Chocolate Volcano Cake was...amazing and I could drink the vanilla bean sauce that came with it with a straw!

I am big into craft brews these days and this place looked like my kind of church.  Reminds me of my favorite church, the Church of the Bloody Mary.  But wait, this is about beer...

The place is huge as you would expect from an old church and a Catholic one, no less.  I stepped in on a Friday afternoon between lunch and dinner time and the place was quite dead.  So I settled in at the bar.  

Some of the beer tanks were located right behind the bar which was on the left side of the ""church"".  The rest of it was in the old altar.  The old pew areas were converted into table seating areas for the restaurant.   They even used the old pews for some of the seating. Very creative.

As for the beer, they had 10 beers on tap which is a lot for a craft brewery.  I started out with a sampler that included 8 of those 10.  All of the beers were served almost warm.  Well it was hot outside and I was looking for a cold beer so I guess the church didn't come with refrigeration or maybe that's how the Catholics liked their beer - warm.

Anyway, none of them really impressed me.  So I was looking at the beer menu and saw the Cherry Quadzilla that I had not tried yet.  That is not part of the sampler because of the higher alcohol content.  They let me sample this and that was the beer I fell in love with here.  I am not normally into fruit flavored beers but there's something about Cherry beers that I enjoy.  Never had one I didn't like.  Just wish they had the Thundergod IPA on tap that some of the other reviewers mentioned.  Oh well.  

I didn't stay to eat here but their menu looked interesting.  The perogie dish is something I would like to try someday if I ever make it back here.  

For beer, I give this a 3.  Because out of 10 beers, you'd think I'd enjoy more than one.

For Atmosphere, I give it a 5.  Who would have thought to put a brewery in a church?

My friend's flight got delayed, so after getting my luggage from baggage claim, I wandered upstairs to see what food choices I had. Unfortunately, the food choices are dismal since I can't visit other parts of the airport without going through the security checkpoints. So if you are here, your choices are Starbucks, Big Al's Chicago Deli, and Track Bar and Grill (which had Budweiser emblazoned all over it and has a NASCAR theme going on). I stepped into Don Alejandro's because initially I thought it was a sit down area for the Chicago Deli. However, at that point I had just flown in from BWI and I didn't eat since 11am and it was now 3pm (6pm EST). The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived, and the place looked clean. There is an issue with their ventilation, as there is a charred (not the good smelling grilled smell but the bad burnt kind) smell that permeated into the dining area during my hour there. 

Staff is quick to greet and seat patrons. They have a limited faux pas Tex-Mex menu. There's taco salad, tacos, enchiladas, etc but there is also burgers, fish 'n chips, caesar salad, and croissant tuna salad. I was fearful of getting the shits from eating the Tex Mex food, so I ordered their Lone Star Burger, which is just a hamburger served with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and your choice of french fries or cole slaw. This is priced at $8.99. It costs extra for cheese. I also ordered iced tea, which was $2.99. The burger comes out in a basket, and the fixings are separate so if you don't like tomatoes you don't have to pick it out of your burger. It comes with a side of mayo and there's mustard and ketchup at the table. For a well-done burger, it wasn't bad. The fries were really good, too. They're the shoestring fries like McDonald's but fried a bit crispier. My server was very nice and didn't intrude too much. Given the food choices here, it wasn't a bad experience. Not great but not horrible, either.

With tax it came to $12.95 and the receipt has a tip suggestion at the bottom at 15/18/20%. Keep in mind that if you are a party of 8 or greater, an automatic 20% gratuity will be applied to the bill.",v_frjRRrLTm4eJchadhf_g,3,10/30/2009,1,review,1,Other,Subway

We came in and the hostess was nice and immediately seated us and that's the only positive of this night. It took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table. The resturant didn't appear to be that busy, there were several empty tables.

We ordered our drinks and before we could mention the food she left the table. We finally got to order our food almost 20 minutes after we arrived. After we ordered the waitress never came back to check on us and the wait for a waffle and french toast seemed awfully long. Finally the food arrives and it all looks great, but no drink refills offered even though our glasses were empty. 

And now the worst part of the evening, our food was cold. Not ice cold but definitely sat for a while. Cold food, empty glasses and we could not nail down our waitress. Finally the manager comes around and asks if everything was alright. We said the food was cold and she asks us if we tried to send it back. We said no, but we tried to explain it's because our waitress never came back to our table or even the section. No apology, no offer to discount the meal she just walked away. 

Pretty unbelievable experience, I was really surprised at the low quality of service and just the general treatment of customers with complaints. The Village Inn is definitely on my list of resturants too avoid.",-r-PA7uWXbpRPeuIZzO3bw,1,12/2/2016,1,review,0,The Strip,Stage Deli Of Las Vegas

The food at Jugoo is a million times better, the prices are comparable if you order the lunch special, and you don't have to hang out in the SU (aka douche-bag central). 

I ordered the two-item lunch special for $9.99 with hot tea, which is complimentary and good quality.  The two-item was a lot of food; they offer a one-item for $6.99 if you're not as hungry.  The lunch specials are served with a bowl of white rice and a spring roll.  The spring roll is not good, next time I go I'll tell them not to give me one with my lunch special because it actually takes away from the rest of the meal.  

With my lunch special I had the dry cooked beef with leeks and the spicy garlic eggplant.  Both dishes were perfect.  Like I said this place is a million times better than Panda Express and they cook the food to order instead of slopping it on a plate from a trough.  The dry cooked beef was stir-fried, tender cuts of beef, served with pleasantly-peppery gravy.  The spicy garlic eggplant was just like the name sounds, pretty spicy and definitely garlicky, tossed in a mildly sweet sauce.
I highly recommend both options.

I wish I wasn't dining solo on this outing to Jugoo, because everything on the menu sounded great and it would've been nice to share other items with some other people.  There's always next time.",3rkxTx8DoZSl7_FryhXCVQ,5,10/4/2011,3,review,2,University,Yayo Taco

Tonight, however, is a different story. The service from our waiter, Kyle was horrendous. It took him a while to even greet us and take our drink orders. He came back to take our meal orders, and I was still deciding, so I asked him to come back in 2 minutes; he came back in 10. That should've been the first sign that the service was going to be bad. He finally brought us our bread, but still not the drink I had ordered. By the time he brought my drink, we were already ready for a second helping of bread. We overheard the table in front of us asking him what was taking so long with their food, and he did not apologize and blamed the kitchen. When we got our food, it was brought out to us by someone else, and when he saw, he hurried over. He asked me if my steak was the right temperature, and wanted me to cut into it to check. By this time, I was no longer hungry, and wasn't going to eat it anyways, so I declined checking. Of course when he walked away, it made sense that he asked about the temperature of the steak, rather than if it was cooked to my liking, because the steak was cold to the touch. I then proceeded to touch everything else on our plates, and all of our food was cold, except for my potato, which had kept itself warm from the oven. At this point, I was done. I asked our waiter for our check and two boxes, because neither of us wanted to eat our cold food. The two tables to our right had a waiter named Howard, who came to check on then every five minutes or so. The gentlemen sitting at those tables came in well after we did, and got their food, hot and fresh, well before we did. On one of Howard's many rounds, I asked him to grab the manager for us. She showed up a few minutes later, and when we explained everything, she proceeded to also blame the kitchen staff. I pointed out that our food was cold to the touch and was not brought out to us by our waiter. She apologized, and said the food was on her, but we would have to pay for the alcoholic drink we had ordered. Instead of taking the check and card in front of her to close us out and get us on our way, she walked away. Our waiter came back to the other tables numerous times, but also didn't bother to grab our check. After waiting another excruciatingly painful, long amount of time, we decided to leave $10 on the table and walk out.",ivgKHakMYMpsV1RIjQruOQ,1,12/4/2015,0,review,0,Summerlin,Americana

However, she did mention that if you request for extra sauce, they will add it to your order. 

We had a couple clusters of King crab, 1.5 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound mussel, 1 pound clams, half dozen oysters, corn, rice, and cajun fries. We order everything with the whole shabang sauce because it is the best one out there.

On those days, Primanti's is what picks me back up.

I'm very sad seeing the number of horrible reviews people have given this place. I'm a current customer, so I know it's not the case that the place has just ""gone downhill"" or whatever. I don't know what people are expecting when they walk in the door, but it's clear that a lot of folks aren't quite getting the magic of the place and its food. It's been said that Pittsburgh has a ""nostalgia-industrial complex"", and maybe that's part of it: I go to Primanti's when I need to remind myself of who I am, where I've come from, and where I'm going. I know that that sounds terribly hokey, but it's the honest-to-God truth. Going to Primanti's is like going back home after a hard day, and seeing people trash it in their reviews gives me the same feeling I imagine I'd get if I saw someone belittling their own child's artwork: the point isn't to decide whether it's a world-class technical masterpiece... the point is to enjoy it for its uniqueness and its idiosyncrasies.",caGXS6ubNTlv91ZZyoirjQ,5,3/6/2010,0,review,0,Southeast,Jersey Mike's Subs

Nothing has changed other than the prices going up, up and up and the flavor going down, down and down.

I ordered the #8 which cost $9.79, it is Penne with Creamy Basil Chicken and a slice of pizza w/small drink. The pasta dish I did not eat because the balsamic tomatoes were just too overpowering and the pasta being the main course of my lunch I was truly disappointed. The slice of pizza was actually very good and I began thinking that I should have just ordered the two slices of pizza combo instead. 

Anyways, I did contact a store Supervisor later to inform of the bitter tasting pasta and she did advise it was most likely that they added too much balsamic to it which could have ruined it.

She was a sweetheart and put my name in the credit book as that I may return and get a replacement meal to make up for the bad pasta dish I had.

LOCATION
=========

Not nearly as big as I envisioned in my head. Their website listed 24 varieties of pizza so I imagines a looooong buffet line. Nope. There's like 10 pizzas out and every 10 mins they rotate new ones in and out. There's also desserts, salad and pasta on the buffet.

THE FOOD
=========

~ MAC 'N CHEESE PIZZA - The best item on the menu. Your basic pizza slice with with Cheddar sauce on top instead of mozzarella. Mac n' Cheese atop... so bad for you but so good. (4/5)

~ CINNAMON ROLLS - Decadently delicious homemade cinnamon rolls topped with icing. They weren't cinnabons but REALLY REALLY good nonetheless. (4/5)

~ ALFREDO SPINACH PIZZA - A creamy alfredo sauced slice, topped with mozzarella spinach and herbs/seasoning on top. (4/5)

~ CLASSIC CHICKEN PIZZA -  Diced chicken, fresh sliced mushrooms with zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)

~ ZESTY VEGGIE - It's a veggie with WHITE sauce. Pretty good. Freshly sliced mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes and black olives with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)

~ BAVARIAN DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Really good. Rich Bavarian cream filling served with sweet crumb topping on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)

~ APPLE DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Surprisingly good as well. Warm cinnamon apples and sweet crumb topping drizzled with icing on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)


~ DEEP DISH PEPPERONI & JALAPENO - It was surprisingly decent. (3/5)

~ BUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust. Closer to a 2.5, it's hard to make a mediocre Buffalo Chicken pizza but they managed. (3/5)

~ OLE - It was ""supposed"" to be like a taco, it's a big mess of whatever. Beef crumbles and fresh lettuce with spicy red sauce topped with shredded cheddar cheese on our traditional crust. (2/5)

~ PEPPERONI - It was ""whatever."" (2/5)

~ PASTA - It was pretty bad. (1/5)

~ BREADSTICKS - They ""looked"" good but they were terrible. Waaaaay too salty. (1/5)


===================
THINGS I WANT TO TRY
===================

HOG FEST - Crisp bacon, Italian sausage, sliced ham and pepperoni with classic tomato sauce topped with shredded cheddar and pizza cheese on our traditional crust.

BBQ CHICKEN - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust.

ZESTY HAM & CHEDDAR - Sliced ham and sharp cheddar cheese with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese on our traditional crust.

GARLIC ITALIANO - Diced tomatoes, sliced red onions and black olives, garlic butter sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and garlic oregano parmesan seasoning on our thin and crisp Italiano crust.

Sure, the inside is cute enough, but then you look at the menu and realize that you probably should have gone somewhere else because the prices are CRAZY high.  Our party mostly came for the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, but since it was getting close to dinner, some of us ordered actual food too.  I would advise you to get your meal somewhere else and come here for dessert, if at all.  

You would expect a restaurant of this popularity to have some quality control.  But no, my friend ordered sweet potato fries and they were hard as rocks.  luckily, our waiter was understanding and sent her a new order right away without question.  A Las Vegas native advised me to skip the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate and get a different dessert, but I stubbornly said that the hot chocolate was what I had come here to try, and I might as well since I can't come here a lot.  Boy did I regret that! For $11, I ordered the Oreo Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, and it was pretty enough.  After drinking a bit, I realized that I could easily make this myself.  The ice wasn't that well blended, and it was mostly whipped cream.

Serendipity 3 appears to think they can get away with having inflated prices with sub par food because there is a lot of hype surrounding them.  They may have duped me into it, but don't let yourself be next.",eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw,1,12/24/2012,0,review,0,Southwest,Babystacks Cafe

I'm glad I tried this place. I went for the pork butt arepa ($4.50) and shredded beef arepa ($5.00), making the cheese upgrade ($0.50) for both. Fried corn filled with a decent quantity of meat is already a recipe for success, and you can add the cilantro sauce (in the yellow or one of the clear bottles) or the spicier red sauce that I sampled a bit of. I think the shredded beef actually had more flavor than the pork butt, but that means the pork butt is a better vehicle for the sauces.

I also tried my friend's fried plantain, which was about as mushy and brown as you'd expect if you just fried a plantain (or banana) on your own at home. It's not very sweet at all, so it's rightfully listed as a side and not a dessert.

The prices could be better given the relatively small portion sizes - I wasn't too full afterward - and the arepas do lack just a bit of the extra flavor oomph that would take it to the next level. However, I could see myself coming back here for future ""one-two punch"" trips.

P.S. Art of Flavors was solid, as usual.

Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.

Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like ""HEY WE'RE READY"". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.

Tortilla soup tasteless.
Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price..
Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.

Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.

Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like ""Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?"" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;) 

Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.

ALL SUMMED UP:
Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED)
Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :)

1. My cup of water was so dirty. There were white things all over the inside. 
2. Lipstick on my napkin
3. I couldn't find the French cheese section so I asked the person in charge on the station and he told me ""I don't know. I just got here?"" And then after he figured it out, he showed me a bucket of shredded cheese. 

Now food.
1. Soup station was messy and cold

When my rotisserie chicken arrived, it seem like a very simply roasted chicken but one bite into it and it was simply amazing.

Our group reserved two sections on the second deck. Walking to our location, I was already impressed by the vastness of the facility, with multiple levels of folks driving their balls off into the horizon and a massive bar inside where people caroused and watched sports. Our section consisted of some comfy furniture, driving greens with a cool laser-operated ball feeder and some handy electronic scoreboards. My game didn't improve much, but I had a blast and our friendly servers kept the green beer (it was St. Patrick's Day) and tasty apps flowing.

The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.

We got there on a Friday night at about 7:15 and had about a 30 minute wait which we thought was fine since we weren't in any big hurry so we decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. My boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic and I had one of the drinks on special Jack w/honey lemonade. The tonic was diet and they didn't say anything so it tasted off, it was also flat. They made him a different drink as it just didn't taste so good so he ordered a Jack and Coke. My drink was very sour. The lemonade needed way more sugar. One thing we noticed is they didn't like to use ice it seemed, within 5 minutes all of our ice was melted. 

When we sat down we looked at the menu and my boyfriend got a pound of the snow crab legs (2 clusters) in the traditional sauce with no spice and an extra ear of corn. I ordered 2 pounds of the crawfish in the trifecta sauce with low spice level and a potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his but it was way to spicy and he had ordered the no spice but it was pretty spicy still. I LOVED my sauce and spice level (which was suppose to be hotter than his but it wasn't). The crawfish were PERFECT. The size were double from other places I've had in the past. The owners were great to walk around and stop at each table, while we had to flag down our server a few times just to get basic items (a drink, tools to crack the crab legs). 

While service wasn't the best from our specific server and drinks from the bartender weren't great either the food was good. I will certainly be back for more seafood but will stick to the trifecta sauce and low spice level.

The ambiance is very cute - like you are sitting in a French courtyard ""outside"".  Overall the food was OK - I wasn't particularly blown away and the prime rib was a bit dry and overdone (but I have yet to find a buffet that serves delicious mouth-watering meat!)  The standouts for me were the crepe station (you can get savory or sweet), the creme brulee, and the king crab legs.  The king crab legs were sweet and not fishy tasting at all - so if you can stock up on those, you will probably make the experience most worthwhile!  I went to 2 buffets which was this one, and the breakfast buffet at Wynn and between the two I have to say Wynn blew Paris away so next time I most likely will opt to try the Wynn dinner buffet.",ZkGDCVKSdf8m76cnnalL-A,3,3/1/2013,0,review,0,Downtown,Andre's

Don't get me wrong.. you definitely see (and taste!) the Jose Andres flair in the menu but CP just doesn't feel special enough to match the food.  It's a simple space w/almost a fast food feel to it... I half expected to go up to the counter to order.  Gladly, we did have waiter service and our waiter was pretty great -- answering all our questions and coming by to check on us quite often. 

The food prices also don't warrant the casualness.. I spent $70 on my half of the 'casual' meal which was well worth it in terms of the food, BUT for that price I'd like to enjoy my dinner in a space that makes me feel like it warrants that amount, know what I mean? 

As for the food, the duck tongue taco and the pork belly sandwich were the standouts. I thought everything was very good but the noodle dish was rather 'meh' and I also didn't quite see what the hoopla was about with the fish taco -- fell kinda flat for me w/not much flavor.  

I'd also skip the desserts...very lackluster. 

All in all not sure I'd return.. save your $ for The Bazaar in LA where the true JA style shines through IMHO. ;-)",GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog,3,1/5/2012,0,review,1,Northwest,Jamaican Spice

I dragged our whole group out here just so that I can check it off of my yelp bookmarks (yeah, i'm THAT friend lol). At least it was easy to find! Just a few miles away from the strip and boom! -- we have arrived.

... to what I am not really sure. 

We might have gotten here quickly, but it was rather disappointing. Literally, a small shopping center with little to offer. And its not even like I am spoiled here-- I'm from LA  and our chinatown is kind of lame too. There were some similarities though that made me feel right at home; the cliche chinese store selling the meditation balls, fart bombs and back scratchers; the bakery that had your typical baos and the grouchy looking lady standing behind the counter; and the boba place-- oh wait, the boba placeS! There were quite a few in this plaza. So, if you're a boba fiend this place is your place to be! ...unless you're a boba fiend that can't make decisions quickly. If thats the case, you will be here for a while, you have at least five to take a pick from. I can't even tell you the name of the place I went for boba-- it was THAT good. meh meh.

I convinced my friends to come for weekend brunch after a wedding rehearsal. We had made reservations but had to add some extra people last minute; the hostess was very accommodating and we got our table in 15min.

They started us with complimentary French bread and vveeerrry smooth butter which was yum.  Shortly after, our food came.  Then the meal turned...average.  I had ordered an appie and an entrée - both came at the same time instead of one after the other, which was kind of odd.  So I ended up eating my Fois Gras with the ruby port gelee and country bread alongside my Hunter's Waffle which I was worried would be getting cold while I ate my appie.  Hm... As for the dishes itself, I don't know if I played it too safe with my dish selections as I didn't feel wowed by either dishes.  The Fois Gras was smooth and the ruby port gelee provided a nice jelly texture mixed in, but overall taste was just OK and not memorable.  I've had better, and probably won't get it again if I come back.  The portion was huge though as I needed help finishing this dish!  The Hunter's Waffle was like a duck confit benedict on waffle; it was nice, but I expected better.  Each component tasted good separately but the combination of the parts didn't elevate the dish.  I tried my friend's Beef Bourgignon Croissant Benedict and we both agreed, it was good but also like the Hunter's Waffle, the flavors failed to combine into a memorable dish.

For the price point, we expected more. Also expected more on the service side.  Maybe it was just because I didn't order a drink (?) as I had 1 glass of water the entire meal not refilled.  I hope my friends at the other end of the table who ordered the bottomless Rose had more luck getting refills.",rbcfYmJtqwIkk17IeOI5Kw,3,7/17/2016,0,review,0,Southeast,McDonald's

The knocks:

- The service was off putting. The cashier had a snooty vibe and gave off  sort of a ""oh, great. more people. ugh, what do YOU want?"" sneer. My sister went up first and ordered a special that was written on a white board, which he quickly snapped they were out of. Disappointed, my sister quickly looked over the board for an alternative and, as she was about to ask for a suggestion, she realized the cashier had already walked away as if her indecision was such the inconvenience to him. Granted, this would be understandable if they were packed, but our group was the only one in line and they weren't all that busy (as evidenced by how quickly our sandwiches came out).

- The seating only works if you plan on ordering take out or dining solo. The bulk of the space is a long counter around the wall surrounded by benches. One of our friends sat facing a post and ate his entire meal starting at it for lack of an alternative. 

- The sandwiches are tasty, but leave a lot to be desired in the meat department. It's a bit scarce here. 

The wins:

- The fries, although not the greatest, come in a giant brown paper bag and are certainly worth their price. 

- The chips- flavored or unflavored- come in the same sized brown paper bag and are served freshly fried. You can tell because they don't achieve full crispiness until they cook off completely but, when they do, they're simply fantastic and addictive. 

If anything makes me come back, it'll be a craving for their chips. Otherwise, it was nice trying food from a place with only two locations, but I'm good with the first go 'round.",W3glSnEBN3--cPX-2aQkvg,3,1/15/2011,3,review,1,The Strip,Ben's BBQ & Smokehouse

By far the poorest service I've availed. It baffles me to read excellent reviews, buy the spa service, and then get ripped off.

I bought a lifetime gift certificate personally from the Holiday Desk 12/24/2011 and, was assured many a times that it would be enough to avail the Spa Service on presenation. So, I gifted it to a close friend who after taking the service (6/30) could not use the certificate as they refused to accept it. The folks at the front desk wanted a number to identify the gift certificate. And, obviously, there was none. So, my friend had to swipe in his credit card as a precaution till they could locate my Gift Card transaction. Next day, he had been charged in full and no one in the Accounting department picked up the phone. Now, it's been more than a week and, we are still not being put through to the manager in charge. We've disputed my friend's card transaction and, will continue the long painful follow up process to get our money back.

So, to the people thinking of buying a gift certificate - I'd think twice. 
And, if you still decide purchase a certificate, insist on a charge card or a Transaction Identifier or a Gift Receipt with a Transaction Identifier and, make sure your friends use up the gift ASAP.

Be Ware though !!

I think the Rio buffet might beat it (from another trip years ago), but it handily surpassed the Parisian Village, the Mirage Wicked Spoon, and Mandalay Bay's buffet from this particular Vegas jaunt.

The Wynn's decor was lovely, but the food was the star. My breakfast had a lot of variety and included more expensive items like seafood and lox. There was both fresh and dried fruit. I think there was a seafood omelet in addition to the omelet station. I had lox-topped pizza. There was probably other stuff but I was too busy with the fish. 

The real awesomeness was in the dessert. Yes, I ate dessert. For breakfast.
 
And I even ate it first.

Bless their hearts, the Wynn staff had out a full dessert spread at 9 AM. Tres leche in a shot glass, lemon meringue pie, little cakes (regular and sugar-free), pastries, eclairs.  

I really love dessert. And a good dessert puts me in my happy place. This is when I close my eyes and let the flavor fill my mouth and pretty much make sweet love to my spoon, one slow bite at a time. It is sweet, creamy nirvana.

I did that in the Wynn. There was a French couple seated next to me, and the male half of the couple kept looking over at me, wondering what I could possibly be eating that was so good. 

No other dessert in all of Vegas put me in my happy place. The Wynn breakfast made my day, and it might have made the day of the gentleman next to me, so it gets five stars.",2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ,5,4/20/2013,0,review,0,Eastside,Yatai Japanese Grill & Pub

The shrimp and catfish arrived on top of a couple slices of white bread, which I guess was there to keep everything from getting soggy in transit. Well spiced, surprisingly good for delivery seafood. The huge serving of fries reminded me of the awesome cafeteria fries from my high school. The macaroni was something like what you'd find at a buffet - bland, soft, but it hit the spot.

Several years later here I am returning to this place almost by accident.

Let's start with the place. Modern, clean, open, dramatic high ceiling, cool bar.

I didn't drink since I was driving but I sipped my friend's dirty martini. Let me put it this way: It was powerful. Two of them would be more than plenty.

The food was really good, specially for the price.

The shrimp cocktail was great, the sauce was spicy and a great presentation. 

The bacon wrapped water chestnuts were pretty good too.

We spitted a chicken sandwich with buffalo wing sauce. It came with a side of fries.

If I have to complaint about something, the fries were a little plain.

But again, the price point, the service, the place, the ambiance make this place a must.

I won't let that much time pass by before my next visit!

Cheers.

43197,0,M9TjYmTgHayJ22cNkyvW_g,h_XeMr1VxTu9sXL1zNtSlw,"I love Savoy. In fact just thinking about Savoy makes my mouth water a little, that's how much I love Savoy.

The first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.

Firstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.

Then there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!

As for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.

The clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!",#NAME?,5,1/18/2015,4,review,1,Summerlin,Americana

The location may seem like a scavenger hunt... if you're coming from Rainbow Blvd., making a right onto W. Sunset Rd., you'll drive up and when you see tall office buildings and shiny reflective windows, you'll know you're almost there.. make a left as soon as you see an entry to go in... stay on the left side of the whole complex and when you see the office building number 8337, it's behind that building and you'll be making a slight right passing it. Baguette Cafe will be next to Bank of America. Hope these directions help in your hunt if you decide to give this cafe a try.

I walked in and was greeted right away with a friendly, sweet smile from a gentleman named Olivier. He asked me my name and if I worked in one of the offices nearby and I told him no, but that I stopped by because I wanted to try this cafe. He was happy that I came here and started to passionately talk about what's the specials are today and specifically told me each ingredient that were in those dishes. He was very informative as if he knew everything by heart to the very last seasoning. I love it when you can tell when someone has the ""fire"" for flavor and food... He enjoyed telling me everything as if he was sharing his favorite recipe with me. All this, while I don't have any makeup on... I know scary right??!?!? It's not even Halloween yet!! Yikes! And he still treated me as if I was his #1 guest. 

I ended up trying the Prosciutto Baguette which consist of: mixed greens, tomato, prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, walnut, and celery spread. My sandwich and a handful portion of mixed green salad that had a tangy dressing on top of it was plated on a rectangular white glass dish. Olivier brought me some utensils and hope I enjoy my meal. 

From the first look at this Baguette.. I was afraid the bread would be tougher than leather to chew and harder than rock to break glass.. BUT it wasn't at all the case. It was tough on the outside, since most baguette are made that way and soft in the inside... almost spongy. The bread was good, but I was chewing way more than I ever did when eating a sandwich. I actually woke up the next day with a slight sore jaw, but I remember Olivier mentioning that I can order it Panini- style instead of Baguette. There wasn't anything wrong with the Baguette, as a matter of fact the whole sandwich was satisfying and all the ingredients complimented each other. The celery spread tasted light and fresh with a touch of tartness... it kept me guessing what's in it, but it was a delicious spread that softened the saltiness of the freshly cut prosciutto. The walnuts even made it mellow, in a sense giving it a smooth flavor. The blue cheese wasn't so profound, but you can taste it was there. Overall, I did enjoyed this meal. I washed my palate down with some Green Tea Pomegranate Iced Tea that they served there. It was the bitter kind without having any sugar, but I like it sometimes like that. 

I bought two muffins on my way out: the Pumpkin and Strawberry. I recall Olivier bringing out a fresh batch of muffins when I first walked in the cafe... they ran out of the Banana Nut Muffin, which I wanted to try, but the Pumpkin Muffin was out of this world delicious! I originally was only going to one bite and start my errands, but it so happens that before I knew it... I did my own magical act and the Pumpkin Muffin disappeared in thin air into my tummy. I know I didn't know I had such talent, but I was still in disbelief that I ate it all in a few seconds. Poof!! Abbra Cudabbra give me another Pumpkin muffin!! :( Sadly I couldn't make it happen and my muffin bag was still empty... darn. I saved the Strawberry Muffin for my date and he asked me if it was still good?!??! Ooo I wanted to hit him upside his head, but no no I'm not a violent person so I told him.. of course it's still good, they made it today!!! What?!? Is he crazy to think I'm going to give him a rotten, spoiled muffin??! Come on! He later told me he ate it for breakfast the next day and it was good. 

This cafe isn't a fast food order and BAM it comes out in a flash... no siree bob... they make it after you order and use the freshest ingredients. If you have time to relax, then you'll enjoy this place... but if you want something quick... maybe a salad or muffin doesn't take that long... they have a good selection of salads if that's something you are looking for. Fraps, hot chocolate, smoothies too! They have outside seating as well and bring out the food for you when it's ready. They even play catchy, fun even romantic french music.. nice listening pleasure while you grab a bite to eat or wanting to relax over some tea or coffee.

Instead of a slightly thicker and more al dente bowl of noodles, my was softer and more closely resembled the thinner egg noodles one might find in Cantonese soup noodle entrees. The noodles lacked ""bite"" and did not create much of the ""slurping factor"".  It is really too bad because the broth was decent.  The pork belly was good and the other ingredients were good.  The main attraction, however, was a bit ""flat"".  I did not feel going to the restaurant was worth the close to $30 round trip taxi fair I paid to/from my hotel.

While I don't expect to be treated like a king I also don't want to hear a sigh when I ask what the special of the day is. I ordered my pizza and wings for pick up and I head that way check in on yelp and find out they have a 2 liter special, though I didn't qualify for it as I didn't order a 16-18' pizza but I saved it for next time, although the low carb pizza does not come that big I will have to figure something else out. Wings are great not as saucy as I like them as I usually dip my pizza in the sauce. The pizza I ordered 12' veggie with cheese low carb option they are usually on point but for some reason it tasted very salty like they over seasoned the veggies not so enjoyable.

Being new residents of Old Town Scottsdale, it took my wife and me too long to get to House Brasserie. We sat on their shady, quiet patio on a perfect day for what turned out to be a perfect lunch--better than any lunch we can remember. 

My wife had a moaning-good chickpea salad that was beautifully presented. I had the lamb cavatelli with green olives and San Marzano tomatoes. We judged both meals to be practically perfect. The chef, to show the kinds of foods he serves his guests at home, created every item on the menu. (How could we get an invitation there?)   

Then for dessert we shared the chocolate cake, unlike any chocolate cake we have seen or tasted. As we were eating dessert, my wife said she had just picked the place she wants to go for dinner on her next birthday! So that's a date! 

We failed to get the name of our waitress/hostess, but the management of House Brasserie should know because we learned she is from Pinetop, Arizona, of Italian and Spanish heritage. She was just superb--welcoming, friendly, informative, and with a delightful sense of humor.

I ordered the ham and eggs, and ordered my eggs ""over well"" and asked the waitress to have my yolks popped, because the sight of egg yolk running around my plate makes me ill. She had a little tude about ""over hard"" versus ""over well"", but I thought we had it settled...

My eggs came burned, with brown crispy crap all over them, and they were not hot. The toast came cold, with no butter or jam. The ham was okay, but ""off the bone"" is an exaggeration. The fresh fruit was good. 

My husband's eggs and steak were not hot, and his toast came cold, with no butter or jam, as well. 

He complained, and the waitress said she would bring new orders to us, at which time I told her to just forget it as far as my order went, because I was STARVING. She brought me a new order of eggs, and I said that I didn't want them, and off in a huff she went. 

When my husband's (new) breakfast was delivered to the table, it was hot and everything was done correctly. However, no toast was present.

The entrées just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I was really disappointed. The meal just wasn't what I was expecting.

 I want to end this review on a positive note.  So lets talk about the customer service at Super Dragon. The service at Super Dragon is great.  The servers made sure our drinks were always full and ensured we had everything we needed or wanted.",SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA,3,10/16/2014,0,review,0,Westside,Chapala's Mexican Restaurant

Me and my bob were craving some late night snack, so we decided to do pizza hut. My bob was wanting there buffalo wings, they looked so good on ther website. So we ordered some. Only$ 6.99 for 8 piece which is not bad,(plus the delivery fee is$ 3.50) so we just got those. 
I called them up and they guy picked up the phone, his name was jo, he sounded he wasn't even on earth when I was talking to him, I had to keep on repeating my order. Finally about the 3rd time I told him my order he said it will be here about 35 to 40 min. I thought it was kinda long for wings but I said ok. 
55 min later, I still haven't heard anything so I called Jo up again and I asked, what is keeping our order, he said wait just a little bit longer, it should be there, wait another 15 min, if he is not there, call us back. So I said ok, waited for actually 20 min, still nothing, so I called him back, I kept my cool and I asked what is going on, he said what is the address again I told him again, than he handed the phone to his manager, I talked to her and she told us that they called us couple times to let us know that we were at the house couple of times for our wings, I stood right by our door the whole time I didn't get any knock or anything. She got a  little bit pissy at me and said well, we will make a new batch, except us in 5 min, I said ok, I walked outside with my computer and waited, they were here in less that 4 min when I got off the phone.
The delivery guy told us he was sorry about all the trouble. Than he started asking us all kinds of questions about our living situation which was not perfectionall at all. 
I didn't really answer him, he was nice though. 
As I walked in the house and looked at the order, it was the wrong order, he they gave us boneless buffalo wings. I went threw all that for them to give me the wrong order, I will NOT be ordering from this pizza hut again, they are others around our area that I will try. I wish you luck at this pizza hut. 

But at the end I just learned to put on a happy face and just the enjoy the wrong order we got, the buffalo boneless was not bad, (there sauce was watery but good). was the same price.",p7Y09Xv3wDUyROO00UhzNQ,1,6/9/2013,4,review,1,Downtown,PT's

Der Kellner war zwar freundlich, machte aber den Eindruck, dass alles schnell gehen muss, damit die Plätze zügig an die nachkommenden Gäste weitervergeben werden können. Dieser Eindruck bestätigte sich, als er uns fragte ob wir noch etwas wünschen, wir nach der Rechnung verlangten, und er die Rechnung schon fertig dabei hatte.
Von der Atmosphäre her ist das Restaurant typisch Hard Rock Cafe: Laute Rockmusik, Star-Memorabilia an den Wänden und die typische Karte, die aus Burgern, Steaks und den üblichen Vorspeisen besteht. Man weiß halt, was man bekommt, wenn man ins Hard Rock Cafe geht.
Während meine Frau den 'Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salat' bestellt hatte, habe ich mir die 'Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs' mit Pommes, Krautsalat und einem Bohnendip gegönnt. Beide Gerichte schmeckten hervorragend, leider waren die Rippchen nur lauwarm. Dafür war das Fleisch aber so zart, dass man es mit der Zunge zerdrücken konnte.
Zum Essen hatten wir noch ein 'Shock Top', eine amerikanische Biersorte, die ein belgisches Bier darstellen soll. War ganz ok, hatten uns aber ein wenig mehr davon versprochen.
Preistechnisch ist es im Hard Rock Cafe natürlich nicht ganz billig, mit der Rechnung bekamen wir allerdings einen 20%-Rabatt-Gutschein für den Shop und da wir da sowieso einkaufen wollten haben wir noch nebenbei 6$ gespart.",1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,4,9/13/2010,0,review,0,Other,Five Star Tavern

There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends. It's because this isn't your average breakfast. They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu. No, they have succulent skillets filled with cheese, hashbrowns, eggs and toppings galore. They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes. They have bacon Belgian waffles. They have oven baked pancakes! The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day! 

During my first official visit here, I ate my heart out. I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites), Chorizo sausage, red jalapeño pepper, onion & cheddar cheese. All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns. As if that's not enough, the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes! The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast! There was no way I could finish the meal, but every bite I took was better then the next. The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it. The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around! I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow, they know how to make a carbtastic pancake! I wish I could have consumed every last bite, but I ate until I was full and left happily full!

I'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's. Now that I know how delicious the food is, the wait time won't seem so bad anymore.",vsFFbN71ehRCp46KeR5RdQ,5,11/3/2012,9,review,8,Southeast,New American Sandwich Co

I was going to get the mixed seafood, octopus, oysters, and shrimp but I had a language problem last night with the nice senora at the register.  I ended up with a shrimp only cocktail but it was everything I wanted!

I got their small size which is called medium for some reason.  There is no small!  The preparer takes a good sized mug and she puts two and a half ice cream scoops of medium sized shrimp in the mug.  Then she adds some pico, an avocado diced in small pieces and fills the entire mug with a tangy tomato sauce.  The pico is fresh cubed tomato, celery, and onions.

With this beautiful mug, you get a basket of chips with a half lime for your cocktail.  Also, the required hot sauce, in this case, Tapatio is put on the pick up counter next to the mug and the chips.  OK, you never have to twist my arm when it comes to hot sauce.

I ate the cocktail in what could have been record time.  What wonderful flavors!  Now I know what I'll do when I get the urge again.  There's another Los Tacos on West Sahara, much closer to me.  I'll go there and get the mixed seafood, large this time, and I'll make a stop somewhere else, El Pollo Loco perhaps, for my gringa wife.

I'm usually not one to do a buffet in Vegas as I don't want to have that bloated feeling from overeating. Thankfully this buffet was full of delicious food that made me want to enjoy it and not just chow down to get my money's worth! 

The crepe station was probably my favorite. They have a list of savory and sweet options and they're all made fresh, however you want them. Bring a few bucks to tip these guys as they are quick and make really delicious crepes. The other areas are set up according to regions in France but if you're like most people it's just different food stations;) They had a good selection of different seafood such as clams, mussels, and shrimp. No crab legs for lunch though, bummer! 

They also have a nice salad area and make sure you save room for the dessert station! The macaroons were awesome and I believe there a few different flavors to try. Everything was great, the price was average for a buffet, and I didn't feel like a whale after eating at least 3-4 plates of delicious food! The buffet was not overwhelming as some can be. There were a lot of choices but not so many that I felt I had to try it all which is probably why other buffets have caused me to feel lethargic after eating at them. 

The service was a little off which is why I can't give them 5 stars. We were there with friends who were Diamond members who had already paid for everyone. When we arrived there was a host that was over-catering to another group and completely ignored us. When we tried to tell another host that we had already paid and just needed to find our group we had to repeat it several times and the host for some reason still could not understand and kept telling us to get in line and pay. It ended up that we finally ended up calling our friends to come out and meet us.

He delivered spicy chicken salads, lamb salads (the dish we had last time), bruschetta, and hummus with pita.  So far, everyone loves it!  I have to say the salads are brimming with crisp lettuce, tender meat, and tasty veggies.  The bruschetta was pretty decent - likely better eaten fresh in the restaurant.  The hummus is so-so, but came with soft pita wedges and a trio of toppers that were delicious.

The restaurant is located at the Quad Hotel. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very upbeat very live and your hostess greet you right on the spot. It was packed for Friday night which is normal for any restaurant. We waited about 15 minutes. We sat outside near the strip so we can see the people walking up and down the street. Our server Chris was funny as hell. He made our first time coming here very fun and he also recommended some items on the menu. The first thing I got was a shot of fireball whiskey. Next the hubby and I decided what we were going to get. He got the off the hook burger. I got the Triple B burger. We got our food the presentation was good. All the burgers come with fries and its just not one set of Fri you have a mixture of fries there are crinkle cut fries Criss cut fries and steak fries all mixed together in a small dish. They are seasoned with this dry barbecue rub that is so good especially when you dip the fries and ranch. Not to mention that the ranch is homemade which is really good. The hubby and I could not even finish our burgers they were so big and so good. We said we would definitely be back because we want to try the tacos that he has on the menu.

'Size does not matter' seems to be the right expression, but I cannot help but think about LA, San Fransisco, Melbourne, and Sydney's homage to Chinese immigrants. Still I will take my stance to say that Las Vegas' serves its purpose. For those into mythology, you are greeted by a statue of the Monkey King from the classic Chinese tale, Journey to the West. It is situated at the center of the plaza. There is some culture for you Las Vegans. 

Just a casual  glimpse around your surroundings you will see everything that is important to Asian people. An abundance of restaurants to spend quality time with your family in. Trinket outlets that are filled with lucky charms, books, and anime statutes. Cosmetic and medicinal shops for our never ending quest to look and stay young. Tea places and bakeries to satisfy the sweet tooth. 

Finally, my favorite, the video store. Get your mind out of the gutter, they do sell dvds of the adult variety, but the variety of Korean dramas with English, Chinese, and Japanese subtitles are what I am interested in. Most range around twenty to twenty five dollars for the series. Korean dramas only do one season, normally consisting of 16-24 episodes. The weekend dramas can go up to the hundreds, but I never looked at how much those are. Sometimes they do clearances where you can get them for ten dollars. The store is located near the elevator.  The store smells like sulfur, or rotten eggs once in a while. I have also walked in, at the wrong time, and saw the person at the desk displaying a sex toy to someone.

Yes, one or two annoying or minor things may happen but that can and does happen where ever you may go. We had a worse time at the Costco two miles down the road that we have ever had here.

Food and booze are served to you while you watch a movie = AWESOME
Groupon deal for $5 a seat = AWESOME

Updated online reservations using the Groupon deal are now available. Paying the $1.50 extra per ticket to purchase on-line is worth the price for busy nights. You avoid standing in line early to buy seats (they do sell out quickly on Fri. & Sat.) You can buy about a week in advance and reserve the best seats. You can print your tickets at a self serve ticket printer in the lobby and avoid lines again. You can roll up to the movie at the last minute and never worry about finding good seats since you already picked them out.

The food is slightly overpriced*, but the portions are large and all the food we tried was good. Besides, they have to make $ somewhere when they keep putting up $5 movie deals on Groupon. I even drive from Warner/101 all the way to Scottsdale and it's cheaper than Harkins for 4 people. *You are not required to buy the food.

For the ranch lovers out there, they have the good stuff like Red Robin. :)  The fries are yummy, thick and crispy. Most items served with fries are in a square bowl so  the bottom fries get soggy under your other food but I don't mind and they still taste good  

The food servers in the theater are polite and very fast to respond to your call light when you need something.  The food comes out quickly and they don't dawdle with the check but are still polite and don't bring it while you are in the middle of eating.

The front lobby area is clean, open and spacious with plenty of seating at and away from the bar.  The bathrooms were clean and well stocked except for once on a very busy Sat. night.

The non counter seats are nice and have the little personal swivel tables. The seats rock a little and are the leather type material, cup holders in the arms.  The counter seats are just black leather office chairs, they are not the best, but still fine for watching a movie. If they upgraded those chairs then I'm sure they would get better reviews but they would still have to roll so you can get in and out from the counter easily.  I went once with a friend of mine whose son is in a wheel chair and those seats were great since we just moved the office chair and rolled the wheel chair right up to the counter.

I decided to give this place another try after my previous customer service experience here a few weeks ago was not good. The first time around, I ordered by number, like I do at a couple other Port of Subs locations here in town. I asked for a #16. The guy behind the counter then started cutting meat of a different sandwich. When I told him I asked for a #16, he became argumentative and replied, ""No, you asked for #18."" I'm pretty sure I asked for a #16 but did not want to argue with him. He then said he could switch to the #16 but his body language and demeanor indicated he would not be happy. I apologized for the miscommunication and told him to finish making the #18. He replied with an obligatory tone, ""Are you sure?"" I replied, ""You're good. Just finish making the sandwich. Now, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and dismissed it as it was about 10 minutes to closing time. He probably wasn't having the best day, and I just wanted my sandwich and go. 

This evening, I was running a little late for work and decided to give this place another try. As I pulled up, I looked through the store window and noticed it was the same person I dealt with the last time I was here, who was behind the counter. I double checked to make sure their place was still open. I had 15 minutes before they closed at 9:00pm. I mumbled to myself as I got out of my car, ""Please, no issues."" As soon as I walked in the door, the guy looks at me with the same look one would have when being caught between a rock and a hard place and said, ""Uh, . . . we just cleaned up everything . . ."" I immediately did a 180 turn and walked out without saying a word.

I work in customer service and have also been a customer service manager. Therefore, my expectations for people working in customer service are a little higher than some. I also used to work in food service so I know what it's like when customers (especially groups of 3 or more) come in during the last few minutes just before closing time, so I can empathize with the workers, and normally try to avoid being *that* customer. However, in this particular situation, I was a party of one and it was 15 minutes before they closed.

My friend ordered a half order of pork chops, cabbage, red beans and rice and yams. Her pork chop was tiny. The red beans were dry. She didn't comment on the yams.

    I enjoyed the seemingly laid back attitude. All the starter said was, ""The putts break away from the towers, have a good time."" At the ritzy, uptight courses, the starters or marshals seem to read you the constitution before you can even tee off. 
    The course was in decent shape. The greens rolled true and there were a few that were two-tiered. The fairways had just been aerated, but I wouldn't knock a course for that. It's maintenance that has to be done. The ""desert"" areas weren't necessarily  desert areas, but spots were ground was cleared and stuff never grew back.
     As far as the layout, It was designed by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish, two well-known course designers. The front nine wasn't horribly difficult, while the back was markedly tougher. There was four sets of tees, with the black (or back) tees stretching out to just over 7,000 yards. There were some tough holes with deep, steep-faced, green-side bunkers, but only a few fairway bunkers. Water came into play on four holes, but there were no long carries over the water. All of the par fives were reachable in two, while the par threes were of the shorter variety. One of the nicer aspects of the course was that not too many holes were laid out next to each other, so you don't have to dodge errant shots from golfers playing the neighboring holes. The drawback to this is the course winds through housing developments and the views of the mountains are obscured.
    The clubhouse seemed nice with a small bar for drinks and sandwiches. The pro shop was adequate with the necessities but didn't have too much in terms of equipment. To buy clubs and such from a golf course pro-shop isn't the most frugal decision anyways. They did have a clearance rack of shirts at good prices.
    Foothills is a course I would play again, as well as recommend to others. While not dazzlingly difficult or breathtakingly scenic, It is a good value, and the atmosphere is an enjoyable one.",wQHfqN3hEMKPg-Z-LArHRQ,3,6/14/2012,1,review,0,Chinatown,Han's Chicken

I really love how they went all out with the ""village"" theme. When you walk in, it really feels like you're strolling through a little village. There are signs, street lamps, little rooms, and buffet stations that look like little cottages. I'm always a sucker for any kind of themed restaurant, so I loved this.

We were quickly seated in one of the rooms and had our drink orders taken. Then we went out to explore the buffet. It looked like they just restocked everything, so I was pretty delighted. There was also a very large selection that seems to continue all throughout the room with separate stations for dessert and soup/salad. I got some broccoli, mushrooms, 3 different pastas, mussels, potatoes, fish, strips of steak, sushi, green beans, roast beef, sausage, cold crab legs, and cam chowder. To be honest, I didn't expect that to fill be up, but it did, so i went on to dessert and got two crème brûlées, a couple cookies, and flan (I'm a slave to dessert).

 About that: It took the hostess several minutes to come out of the back of the restaurant and to the host stand at the entrance. There was a party of two ordering to-go at the hostess stand. Instead of seating me while they made up their mind, the hostess stood there as they hmm'd and haaa'd over the menu, clearing not knowing what most of it meant.

It pretty much extends all along Spring Mountain Rd and it's not too far from Korea Town. It's also really close to The Strip!

There are so many different authentic Chinese restaurants to choose from as well as many popular dessert places. Volcano Cafe (originally Volcano Tea) is one of the most well-known boba places in Vegas. It's been around for years and is in the heart of the plaza. Another one would be No. 1 Boba Tea inside of the Chinatown Mall.

Parking is never a problem here. Plus it's free! Many people think Chinatown would just have Chinese-based restaurants, but the one here in Vegas has grown to house so many different Asian restaurants. Filipino, Thai, and Korean are just a few to name.

Many of the businesses are either open really late or 24 hours! If you're in town, please don't forget to make a visit to the Chinatown Plaza.

If you're not sure what to try, here are a few recommendations and some of my faves:
-Noodle Pot
-Volcano Cafe
-Sunville Bakery
-Diamond Bakery
-Thai Noodle House
-Lee's Sandwiches (Open 24 Hours)

It has a lot of character, I won't dwell on the basement, we all know about the basement (OK, well if you don't know there is a coven of creepy dolls which congregate behind a fence, why? I'm not sure exactly). 

Hanny's is more than the dolls, but not much more. The food is reasonably priced and it shows in the quality. That's not to say that the food isn't good but that's not the draw. The real reason to come to Hanny's is the atmosphere and the 5$ martinis. 

Speaking of 5$ martinis I had an awkward exchange with a bartender here one time when I asked for a dirty martini straight up, he went on to inquire if I wanted that ""on the rocks"". Confused, I bantered back with him for about 5 minutes before he finally understood, it wasn't the misunderstanding that bothered me, it was the arrogance. Over the years I have come to understand that this type of hipster service is consistent at this establishment.

Regardless, I will continue to frequent Hanny's, it's centrally located, there is usually a good DJ up in the booth and the food is decently priced (they also have gluten free options).

So this review is just of their food, though their service was good - no complaints. (Actually, two bartenders fought over serving me...luckily, the male-half of them won out. :-) )

The burger was $20 and I would only spend that on a burger and fries in Vegas. Otherwise, this was worth about $13. Don't get me wrong; it was good, just too damn big. Eventually, I had to use the plastic fork and knife. And the Mac & Cheese stayed with the burger, which I liked. 

The fries were a mixture of two brands; very nice. Unfortunately, the ketchup they gave me to go I had to be extremely conservative on since it was such a small portion.

And speaking of small portions, I'm gonna need to order their smallest burger next time. This was a chore to eat. Again, still good, just hard to eat. I do have a big mouth...just not for actual food.

It's nice to eat off the Strip sometimes.  It is definitely oddly located, and we missed it at first.  It was pretty dead for lunch, so we didn't have to wait long to get our food.  So we asked about the beef, and it turns out that the beef comes from Kansas and some other corn states.  The waiter had to ask someone in the back, but he said that the cows are grass fed.  They ground all the meat in-house.

Prices are definitely on the pricier side considering the portions.  In fact, my friend had to order another burger to split w/ someone bc he was still hungry.  All the burgers had a similar taste - I think the patties were glazed with some sort of sweet sauce, but the toppings made a difference.  We tried three burgers, and all were good, though I liked the Bachi Burger the best.  

-Bachi Burger, Kalbi Burger, and Bahn Mi Burger - I'd recommend all of them, though the Kalbi Burger was nothing special.  The kim chee they use is not spicy at all and is made from regular cabbage.  
-Pork Belly Buns - Good but not filling at all.   You get two tiny buns.  Nice for a snack, maybe.
-Truffle Parmesan Fries - Shoestring crispy fries.  Yummy!!  We also asked for a side of the pineapple ketchup - they should really bottle that stuff.  
-Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee ($3.50) - This had an interesting taste bc the whipped cream was made w/ salt.  It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked but it was definitely different.

Another friend came later and ordered the turkey/chicken burger, but it never came.  Apparently the waiter forgot, so she ended up canceling it after waiting a long time.  The bill came to about $51, not including tip.  Our waiter, who reminded me of Jimmy Fallon but taller, was nice and did his best to answer all our questions.  I'd definitely come back my next trip to Vegas, though I wish the portions were bigger!!

50862,33,JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,oKhASa39pfICurzmuNkKig,"Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting décor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a ""secret menu"" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in ""Goodfellas"" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is ""Omakase"" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.",Thx8WO-qqYJmEKssu4g9SA,5,2/4/2013,46,review,42,Westside,McDonald's

Wasn't to keen on the hoagie roll (mainly because I'm used to pulled pork on hamburger buns), but that's inconsequential due to the fact that the pork was awesome. This is my main method of judging BBQ joints and they passed with flying colors. Added to that, the greens were perfect. If you've been missing collards, mustard, or turnip greens, this is a great combination of all three. Definitely check in first so you can get the dessert. I didn't but the server didn't mind adding the order, which was nice because of the consideration. I got the banana pudding which was good, but I would have liked to have had some bananas in it.

Hooray #2- since it is located in Tivoli Gardens and has outdoor seating, it was awesome to be able to bring our dog to the party!! We sat outside at the shaded tables and had a great time!!

Good, attentive and friendly server. The only thing she did that was irksome to my husband was ask if we wanted dessert or ""just the check"" right after we started eating. I had just started my second piece of pizza. Would be helpful if they offered their employees a bit if service training even though it's a pizza place. A dirty table sat next to us our whole dinner. 

Here is some more food for thought:
A few inconsistencies to what was an otherwise awesome experience.......
VERY simple menu. Normally this wouldn't be a biggie, but the offered pizza toppings lacked pizzazz. Loved the roasted garlic purée, but everything else was very basic, like they don't know the clientele they are serving. Plain button mushrooms? The menu offers a roasted veggie panini. Perhaps you could offer those veggies on your pizzas. ?? Even meat eater options were boring.  No specialty combo pizzas offered. 

 Next, The green salad was a cup of mixed field greens and 2 tomato slices on a salad plate which was brought out with  red wine vinegar and oil. I asked for a balsamic vinaigrette and was brought the same balsamic reduction (thick!!!) that was on my husbands caprese salad. 
For pennies, you could create a decent salad and dressing. Head over to Tivolis Saturday Farmers Market and pick up a few things if you need to, but don't insult customers with lettuce on a plate. Especially Summerlin customers in the food service industry. 
Also, throw out an order or breadsticks or your garlic knots or even your potato chips for people while they wait.  We waited a good time for even our salads and had nothing to pick on. Just might be a nice touch to serve a breadstick or two with the $5 plate of greens and $8  caprese salad, too. 
Drinks: The ice tea had run out at 5 PM and the root beer 'liter' had tapped dry, too- my son had to switch to lemonade. Strange. Are they serving out of 2 liters??
Send someone to the store then!
Pizza:
My husband and son ordered a huge 18"" mushroom, onion and roasted garlic pizza. It came out Ooey and gooey! Aside from the orange pool of grease, it was a tasty pie. However, for $1.00 per topping, they seemed skimpy here too. You could count the mushroom pieces on the entire pizza on both hands. 

My pizza- the vegan 12""!!! Having had vegan pizza many times in LA, I am spoiled. But I was very surprised, even happy, at my pizza!!!! I got mushrooms and roasted garlic and loved it. They cooked the dough properly and the texture of everything was great!! I'm going to try it next time with their pesto!! 

Overall- this was a really fun time. Scored because it was vegan and pet friendly! We will be back often and hope the kinks  get worked out. It has the potential to be a real cool little hang out !",Pwb0tGwDCa-Z7Eg2zqfhXg,4,7/13/2011,2,review,1,Eastside,The Coachman's Inn

They were so nice though we never even realized it! We got everything family style and honestly, there was not one thing we ordered that went unfinished or unappreciated. We started with the carpacchio con ruchetta, which was perfect. I have to admit that while I've never had bad carpacchio, I'm sure it exists, and I have had overly dressed or on the contrary very bland carpacchio. This was fabulous; it was lemony enough and most importantly salty enough with the perfect proportion of parmesan and arugula. Overall, super tasty. We also split the insalata di pere, which had lots of yummy, tangy blue cheese and was a really well put together salad. For our entrees we got the Salsiccia Piccante pizza, Barilotti Integrali Al Forno, and the Gnocchi Bolognese. All were delicious and among the five of us, we closed the restaurant down and ate every last morsel of food.

We were seated within 5 minutes and then we waited a while for our waiter. Finally, we ordered, and I got the tomato soup expecting a nice simple red soup with maybe some basil. I was extremely disappointed when the tomato soup came out a while later with beans and onions and the flavor was spicy. The soup was chunky and nothing like a tomato soup I have had before. It was not good and cost me about 10 dollars of something I was only able to eat 1/4 of. 

I wish I had ordered a sandwich with the salad because it looked much better than what I got. This place does have a huge menu and it's my fault for picking probably the worst thing on it. 

I would give this place another chance but the service was really slow, granted it was late, and I just wish my soup was better. Overall one of my least favorite meals I have had in a long time and it should have been much better.",NvKNe9DnQavC9GstglcBJQ,1,11/27/2015,0,review,0,The Strip,Jac & Ray

First of all, they have a huge patio, volleyball courts, ping pong, corn hole... you could basically stay there all day and have a great time. 

The beer selection is great, I've never been there and haven't found something new and different to try. They tend to stick with regional breweries with I like but have some pretty good micro brews from the entire US. Oh, if you are a bud lite person they have that too, though people might look at you funny. 

I think one of the best things about this place if that the food is LEGIT. German style plates that are delicious. If it's your first time, you cannot leave without their soft pretzel with beer cheese. I know some girls that would rather go out with this pretzel and beer cheese than their boyfriends... and vice-versa. 

Service is ok, one thing that annoys me (when not too busy) is that they take your beer as soon as you finish it.. sometimes even before your last sip... some people just call that a good way to keep your glass full... it's irritating at times.

Their masalas and curries are great and genuinely spicy.  They also have just as many vegetarian options as they do options for carnivores, which is a plus.  It also helps that these vegetarian options are tasty.

Avoid any of their sauced dishes described as ""bone-in"" or ""with bone"".  Bone shards can be found throughout these dishes, and while tasty, a bone can be a real turn off texture wise if you don't break a tooth on it.  That said, this is a minor downside.

Notes:  Baskets of naan like baskets of chips at a Mexican restaurant?  Oh hell yes.  Also, paneer varies from restaurant to restaurant.  The paneer at Mint Indian Bistro is like a firm tofu, which is my favorite style of paneer.  Those of you preferring a creamier paneer are officially on notice.

If you love bacon, you have to check out the smoked Applewood bacon.  Even if you are not a  bacon lover, you'll fall in love with these nice smokey slices.  Nice and thick and cooked to perfection.  

I had the Hog and Chick with thick sliced bacon.  3 slices bacon, 2 eggs, hash browns or home fries and your choice of toast.

What is the difference between hash browns and home fries you ask....hash browns are shredded potatoes cooked in butter.  Home fries are chunks of potatoes cooked in olive oil, rosemary and onions.  

Hubby had the special of the day.  3 meat scramble with hash browns and flour tortillas.  This is definitely a meat lover's delight.  They do not skimp on the meats either.  Canadian bacon, Chipotle  and Cheddar sausage and Spicy sausage and cheese.

Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.

The abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.

So I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's ""temporary relocation away from Las Vegas"" party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.

Just like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.

[Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]

Summer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.

Cuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.

I also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.  

Sweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.

The Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.

Overall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.

If you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.

3 stars!

We went to Ol' Ron's based on the reviews.  We quickly realized there are two reasons to visit this particular area if town and those are to visit Ron's or get an Asian massage.  We just stuck with the donuts.

The donuts were fresh and incredibly good! The staff ( which we assumed was Mr. and Mrs. Ron) were very nice and did not get at all upset as we asked what basically every donut was.  

The icing on the donut was the price! Holy crap was it cheap! We got 6 ""fancy"" donuts, two coffees, and a bottle of water for $12.

Thank you Mr Ron for your amazing piles of dough and icing.

There were six of us and only three were drinking (which the server did not seem happy about).  We started with some Jameson/Gingers and then their house drink the Dublin Donkey.  We were asked by our server, Erin, if we wanted doubles.  We said yes.  After the first sip, we all commented on the lack of whiskey in the drinks, but our server was not to be found so we decided to deal with it.  Now, I've worked in the restaurant business most of my life and have drank at many high end bars across the country, so I know a double should cost more.  Usually it has been anywhere from $2-$6 added to the initial price of the drink.  So imagine our surprise here when we discovered that a double was actually 2x the price of the drink.  Translate this to $15 jameson/gingers and $18 Dublin Donkeys!!  
We were appalled!  7 drinks, 3 shots... $125!!!  We confronted the server about it and she rudely told me how thats the policy because its double the alcohol and refused to change the check (despite our insisting that those drinks were in no way ""doubles"").  
While the price was outrageous I would have been able to get over it if the environment was outstanding (our drinks were served in plastic cups) or the service (Erin was no where to be found half the time, and acted as if she hated her job).

The day after I called to ask the manager if this was really the policy.  With a rude tone, I was again told that that those drinks were indeed that expensive!  No attempt to right this obvious scam was given!

He explained what everything was.  Eric R. ordered a mula with flour tortillas and suadero, and a cabeza taco.  The mula is like a tortilla sandwich with cheese and meat, so a deconstructed quesadilla of sorts, and comes with choice or corn or flour tortillas.

I ordered a lengua taco and a lengua sope.  The sope is like a corn cake that is stuffed with the meat, and here topped with a crispy corn chip.  The chef insisted we take an adobado taco con pina on the house, which was very nice but he did that only after I told him I do not eat pork.  Eric R. ate it.

There are radishes and limes but no salsa bar.  The lengua was delicious.  I have a hard time disliking any lengua taco in general, and this was very tasty.  The sope was great too - for me it was a fork-and-knife situation because it was very thick but too wide to lift up and bite.  Eric R. enjoyed his cabeza (""tastes like suadero"" he said) and his mula.  He was so full but ate the adobada too.

We were only there for like 15 minutes but we smelled like burnt meat the rest of the day.  It was in my hair and my clothes, and same with my hubs - it was like we went to a local casino and smelled like smoke in a way.

As a Las Vegas local I am always on the lookout for new restaurants and lounges to try that are off the strip. When I was first introduced to DW Bistro it was love at first bite! The restaurant has both inside and outside dining options. This is a big deal to me because I am someone who likes to sit outside and enjoy the nice Las Vegas weather when the extreme heat decides to give us a break. All of the staff is super friendly and great at remembering returning faces! Sometimes you can even catch the owners Dalton and Bryce in their visiting with customers!

DW Bistro has one of the best Sunday brunches in Las Vegas. It is so good the line often goes out the door! BUT have no fear, it's always a short wait and totally worth the mouth watering tease as you watch plates of Jamaican and New Mexican style food pass you by! Every meal I have had at DW Bistro has been an explosion of flavors and spices complimenting some of my favorite dishes. When it comes to breakfast I am a huge eggs benedict fan. When I saw that DW Bistro had eggs benedict on their menu I was very excited to try this. I asked if they could add some of their New Mexican style slow cooked pork that is simmered in New Mexican red chili on top of it and they gladly had no problem. It ended up being the best decision I have ever made. The mix of the red chili, tender pulled pork and hollandaise sauce made for one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. REMEMBER - The eggs benedict is on their menu but you have to ask for the New Mexican style slow cooked pork to be added.

Lunch is always something I have a hard time with as I am never really too hungry at lunch and seem to never be able to make up my mind on what I want. I decided to try their chicken flautas since they sounded so good and seemed like a small enough dish that I wouldn't leave feeling overly stuffed. When they brought me the dish I was very impressed! First, you could tell they put a lot of thought into the presentation which of course made for an awesome food porn Kodak moment! Second, the taste was out of this world. They drizzle fresh lime infused sour cream on top which taste delicious and add avocado tomatillo on top. I was very impressed.

When it comes to dinner DW Bistro will never let you down. From the Chicken with roasted garlic & cream sauce over bowtie pasta to the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork, each meal is sure to pack flavor that will blow you out of this world. I went with the New Mexican-style slow-cooked pork simmered in NM red chile. The bowl is served with over-easy eggs and rice with a fresh flour tortilla. The meal is a little large and I never finish it. There is so much flavor in the pork and the red chili that I didn't want to stop eating it.

If you are looking for a highly recommended local Las Vegas restaurant, with great prices, amazing service and food that is guaranteed to give you a whole new perspective on Jamaican and New Mexican style cuisine then DW Bistro is the place to go!

Went tonight and the place was nearly empty.  That should have been my signal to turn around. Ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with angel hair pasta.  Meatballs were rubbery and had likely been sitting around all day heating (yes, it's 8:30 PM, but if the place is open, I kinda want fresh food).  Meal was overall ok--not wowed, no food poisoning, but the night is still young.  

To echo the comments about the wait staff, very disinterested.  The thing that sealed it was the beverage 'refills' or lack thereof.  I'm drinking soda.  The waitress comes by and grabs the glass when it's 1/3 empty and replaces it.  Fine.  I get the bill and she's charged me for two sodas.  Most nearly everyplace does free refills, especially for a $2.75 soda--and if not, she should at least ask if I wanted another one instead of just taking it.  Soft drinks aren't even listed on the menu so I'd have no way of knowing the cost, much less that refills were not complimentary.  I deducted the cost of the second beverage from the recommended tip and left a $0.75 gratuity.

In the past I've had their grilled cheese w/tomato soup which was absolutely amazing. 
Their Chicken Salad - Chicken is super juicy and flavorful
Their Border Burger - Which quite honestly go with the Turkey Sandwich or one of the other two above. 

Okay, now like I mentioned food was good, but here is where the rating comes in. We came here on a brunch day and it wasn't too busy. Soooo I'm not sure why the service was so disappointing. Our drinks took forever to be served, a good 5-7 minutes, once they were served it took about another 10-15 minutes for our server to return and take our order. We ordered unlimited mimosas and in the 3hrs that we were dining here, well waiting more than dining, we were only checked up on 2-3 times. At one point the whole restaurant looked absolutely empty and we could've seriously walked out and no one would have noticed. Service should never be this slow when the restaurant isn't busy.

But do be aware I was burping and tasting garlic for several hours later.  My only negative comment on the place would be their heat scale.  I got the clams less than mild and they were more like hot.  They did inform us that the heat scale was hotter than average and at times I do love something scorching.  But this time I was looking more for abundance of flavor instead of just hot.  Made it more difficult to discern flavors.  other than that we had a great experience and will come back again.",UNI1agsPX2k3eJSJVB91nw,4,2/27/2013,0,review,0,Westside,Cici's Pizza

My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and fries though. 

The second time I returned, (about a month later) the menu had changed and so the only items on the menu were burgers and hot dogs (aside from the apps). Even the salads had burger meat in them.

I ordered the Cowabunga burger since my options were limited. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, neither was my boyfriend who also got a burger. The prices were also kind of steep considering it's $10 and all you are getting is a burger with no side. 

When my burger arrived it was cooked more than my liking, and it also lacked flavor, which was weird again, considering the toppings (pineapple, etc).

Looking at their menu, they had such unique and fun names for the drinks such as ""The Bored and the Beautiful"". I ordered the ""Hunting Season"" which sounded like a heavenly mango bloody mary but unfortunately since mangos were not in season, they had to change up the drink a little bit but it was still yummy. The drink I'll always remember is their GRAPEFRUIT BEER! If you love fruity drinks, you MUST get this. I could drink this all day and everyday... if my asian glow/ allergies would allow me to :(

I probably spent half my time here being mesmerized by all the unique decor. I love the quote above the bar, the chandeliers hanging in the hallway, the beautiful outdoor patio with vintage hanging plates and the hidden smoking area with a TEETER TOTTER! I hadn't been on a teeter totter since I was like 4 so I was definitely a little too excited and a little too intoxicated which led to a very painful memory so beware haha. They clearly put a lot of attention to detail in their decor and it's definitely eye catching and distracting!

There is also an eccentric twist to their vintage decor which was a little creepy for me.... there were one too many pictures of voodoo-ish girl dolls in the bathroom and some lightly morbid decor like the stuffed birds around the bar area that were a little too much for me. I will admit that I was scared that Nancy S. and I were scared to go to the bathroom alone LOL. Maybe it was me and my paranoia but I just felt a slightly haunted vibe going on there. 

Despite the creepy things that bothered me a little bit about this place, I would definitely be back for their drinks and cool vibe. If I lived in Vegas, I feel like I would be a regular here.

Subject: Why you gotta be so mean?  

""Hi, Doug, I was your bartender both times you came into 92nd Street Café.  I must say that I am extremely offended by your unwarranted, hateful comments.  You have ordered TWO items on our menu, obviously they didn't appeal to YOU, but was it necessary to call the place, and I quote, a ""slop house""?  I offered to do anything to make the experience better for you, but you would have none of it.  You didn't want to be happy, you wanted to be mean and insulting.  I tried.  Funny that you couldn't find it in your review to mention that Stephanie enjoyed her pancakes or that I provided good service.  Instead you used an all over generality to condemn the entire place over two dishes.  FYI, 8 orders of biscuits and gravy served at the bar, only complaint was yours.  Bad mood? Likely.  I hope Stephanie returns.  She was a really nice person.  Sincerely, 
Kelly Sheppard"" 

I stand behind my second review 110% and what I find funny is that Kelly apparently did not take the time to read my first review which was very complimentary and for the record, she never offered anything to ""make it better"" .... If I go to a restaurant two (2) times and get bad food or bad service, I write them off.

Not only did he break every rule of serving etiquette, but he seemed to go out of his way to be disrespectful. He couldn't be bothered to give us a wine list, instead telling my cousin which wine she would want. (Which was dreadful). When I ask what he had that was very dry, he told me I'd like the Pinot Grigio because it was ""really dry and sweet"". I'm certain those two things are opposite. I did not try to correct him. I asked for the salad with dressing on the side. It came on the salad. I again did not say anything. I ordered the same dish as an other person at the table only mine was extra spicy. When I asked if mine was the spicy one, given his earlier mistake, I was admonished with ""well that's what you ordered isn't it?"". The general rudeness continued in every interaction with him until it culminated when I asked where the bathroom was. He just said ""in the back"". I asked for clarification and that's when he very condescendingly said ""oh let me lead you"". As I walked away he said, loud enough for the whole table to hear, that I was ""pretentious"".   I have never not left a tip, and was still planning on giving him the standard 20% until I heard he had said this. I left no tip, but a note recommending that he not speak poorly of patrons within ear shot of their companions. He chased me out of the restaurant, screaming at me down the side walk. 
The service was so poor that even if the food had been amazing I would still give this place 1 star, but the food was mediocre at best.

The food is excellent - not on the inexpensive side, but definitely worth the money for such good quality and taste.  I'm particularly fond of the Mezza Chicken Limone and end up getting that almost every time we go, although I've had the chopped salad as well and it's great.

I like that the menu flags a number of items that are under 595 calories so if you are counting them at all or just want to know what might be a healthier choice - they make it really easy.

I would have ordered the more commonplace (apparently) onion straws but I had them before and didn't care for them that much.
I wound up getting fries which were overcooked, tasteless, and obviously the scraps leftover from the lunch rush.  At least, if you're a ""gourmet"" burger place, offer decent fries.  The tater tots that my daughter got with her hot dog were very good though and I ate off her plate.
On to the burger.  I feel it is a restaurants responsibility, if I order a burger, no matter what I put on it to provide me with a non messy or soggy, burger that is well put together and provides a taste of all the topping in each bite.  This burger fell short of this expectation.  I ordered it Med Rare, and it was so greasy / soggy that the bun was saturated and the burger had to be eaten with a fork and knife (man point deduction).  So, the bun was not strong enough, and the burger was too ""wet"".  They also didn't distribute the toppings evenly and as a result they were all over the place.  I think if more care was given to the preparation it would have turned everything around.  Just slopping a burger and toppings on a bun when I'm paying the $$ I paid for this lunch isn't going to generate repeat business.
I like the concept of Bad Daddy's, I really do.  I may go back again, but to be honest there are plenty of places to get a burger and this past experience was lacking.",YXa0A7aXV9wWNR0qJVVSDg,2,11/25/2012,0,review,0,Westside,Morettis Eatery
4808,0,LNLTqEfmjoZG07tE1HFmTQ,GtKunzCnn_t_kSNooV4Maw,"I'd never give this place a less than stellar review having had two really good experiences here before, but I do have some helpful suggestions for both customers and staff after a recent attempt to visit. We brought my mom here on an early brunch/lunch break and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes. About 40 minutes later, we were still being told that several tables of customers were finished but still just hanging back and chatting and there wasn't anything that could be done for us. We ultimately had to go to Chloe's Corner for something quick, wishing we could have that wait time back for the sake of little remaining time together, though we'd made the trip to Kierland for Snooze and were assured it would be any minute for a while. During our wait, we overheard and saw a hostess arrange the system and a table our size for who appeared to be her friends who came in a while after us, which was a bummer, but they did have a little girl with them so we were forgiving of being questionably cut ahead of like that. We figured we'd also be seated shortly, but it eventually meant we would never get a table.

It is such bad etiquette on customers' behalves to hang back and ""snooze"" when your servers have a living to earn, and other people might want to eat a new/popular restaurant, too. I think there are polite remedies that could be better implemented to avoid losing business and no longer seeming very appealing as an option for future visits, with the current gamble of a wait time structured to accommodate finished, lingering customers better than new ones. Collect the final bills back and clear the tables completely, asking if there's anything else that they need today, and thank them for coming in. Or, politely inform customers who have been paid up for a while that there's ample space at the bar since other parties have been experiencing unusually long waits for tables today, rather than sending those who have been waiting for tables there or in the current blazing heat to eat as a family. Everyone is so friendly there, I don't see that being offensive at all, but what was a little offensive was being given a very short wait time initially and ultimately having to be turned away after all. I felt like perhaps more could have been done, and maybe would have if we weren't very easygoing people. I'm not knocking the restaurant so much as inconsiderate customers who are overly taking advantage of the laid back atmosphere, but from a business and customer service perspective, surely something more should begin to be done better in these cases after what we experienced today. For a place that closes at 2:30, that's a huge discouragement for future visits for individuals who don't have hours to kill, or don't wish to be unpleasantly surprised by the lack of availability for them after all, after waiting long periods of time only to be told, ""sorry."" I'd imagine this could become a big problem as our population increases in cooler months with customers less likely to bite their tongues, and that's a shame because the staff typically could not be nicer. Service has been wonderful when the wait wasn't an issue in the past, with exceptional wait staff and food. But please be more proactive about finished, overly chatty tables, who have hopefully already had a satisfying experience so that others may enjoy the same that day. Starbucks is right next door for those who want to stake claim of an empty table for hours for free!",RwlumSqNBunw1a1LXccN8A,3,9/25/2015,2,review,0,Eastside,Firefly

I was able to score a year of free Swedish meatballs for my family while a couple of my friends actually camped out for a day and a half for couch and mattress giveaways.

The space itself is humongous.  On the 2nd level, the spacious restaurant serves up great deals on breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   $1 gets you a small breakfast consisting of sausage links, scrambled eggs, and potatoes.  $1 also gets you four of their famous Swedish meatballs.  The meatballs are small but they are delicious.  Coffee is complimentary until 10 AM.

Wandering along the 2nd floor, you'll pass by an entire showroom floor full of innovating ideas on how to spruce up or modernize your home.  From kitchen concepts to living room and bedroom needs, everything you need for the house of your dreams can probably be found here.

The first floor hosts a children's play area where you can leave your young child to play in the ball pits under staff supervision for up to an hour of shopping around.  On this floor there's another long and winding path filled with lighting, kitchen accessories, bathroom decor, and so much more.  Ikea is huge and getting lost is highly probable but you won't mind.

The entire store was quite organized with regards to controlling pedestrian movement and vehicle traffic.  Lines formed around the restaurant but moved at a good pace.  While not yet to the point of triggering someone's claustrophobia,  I would suggest waiting a week or so for the crowds to die down a bit.  Avoiding after 5pm when people get off work is highly suggested as well.

If you've never stepped into an Ikea before than you're in for a nice treat.  Wander the floor and score some tasty Swedish meatballs.  The experience is quite fun and finding that inspiration for your home will be as satisfying as ever.

Location, location, location.  Selwyn's will continue in spite of its poor ownership and management, which is a shame.  I went there Sunday to order a pizza to go and grab a beer, watch a game while I waited.  Went to the outside bar which was relatively empty and sat down.  Looked down the row and most people had empty drinks and the guy next to me was looking to cash out.  However, the bartender would have nothing to do with that.  He was engrossed in a deep conversation with a friend.  Both looking down at a cell phone and have extensive dialogue.  Never once did he look up during the 15 minutes I sat there.  Eventually, I got up to walk inside to get service.  As I walked by the bartender and his friend, I saw they were deeply engaged in a Clash of Clans discussion.  I now understand, that can be serious work if in the middle of a war.  The patrons can clearly wait this out.

When I went inside, the bartender inside was great.  Put my order in immediately, got my beer and was out the door 20-30 minutes later.  

Here is the problem.  Whoever manages the place, doesn't really manage it.  Some people are great and attentive, however the majority of the staff could not care less about the customers.  I've had several of these instances there.  Wait staff that decide to take a food break in the middle of service, leaving us to get up and get napkins, order drinks at the bar and then finally interrupt her eating with another server so that I could finally ask to cash out.  I've waited long periods of time while wait staff breeze by, never taking an order, mostly congregated somewhere talking to each other.

I love the place.  The food is good for the type of place it is.  However, somebody has to get people in place who care.",ZBHXfX3vK-ck52UBEofV2w,1,4/8/2015,2,review,0,Southeast,Dazzling Bistro Food Truck

Their chicken & waffles are admittedly not as creative or upscale as others I've had in the area - it's pretty much just straight-up fried chicken & old-fashioned buttermilk waffles - but I appreciate the simplicity of a meal done right, & this is a good one. It's big, too, so it'll keep you full, & oh, yeah, it's drenched in Ohio maple syrup, so it'll also keep you happy & home-state proud. Also delicious are their ribs, which I've only stolen from my boyfriend's plate, but they seemed pretty damn good. Sorry, I'm mostly a chicken & waffles girl.

Good vibe in this place, too, kind of garage-feeling with a small outdoor seating space & a lot of light but somehow still cozy.

50861,0,hkSTeVnKsPM_dQeD5GWsTQ,fQgYt36fuJWUvynVk_mfxg,"I was staying at the Venetian and was hoping to find a reasonably priced Italian option with good quality and this place seemed like a nice fit.  I arrived ~ 8:30 pm on  Wednesday and was promptly seated.  I was seated outside of the restaurant proper so there was a decent amount of ambient mall noise, but it was not overwhelmingly loud here.  There was some background music playing as well that was barely audible.

I started out with the burrata with arugula which was disappointing.  There were two thin slices of tomatoes that were devoid of flavor and other than the taste of the cheese, the salad was bland.  The mozzarella cheese was creamy and tasty, but there was not sufficient balsamic reduction to add some complexity.

While I was waiting for my entrée, I munched on the bread which had a burnt crust which gave a bitter taste and the bread was not warm (room temperature).  The butter was foil wrapped in those individual packets but at least it was soft in texture and easy to spread.

For my entrée, I ordered the lobster supreme which is a pan seared lobster tail with shrimp on a bed of linguini.  This dish was pretty good with some minor flaws however.  The lobster was a little overcooked and it was difficult to pry the meat off of the shell since they did not provide me with one of those tiny lobster forks.  For the most part, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, but two pieces were overcooked.  The pasta was el dente and the tomato based sauce was very yummy.  This was the best part of the meal and the portion was decent sized.

I got a free cannoli dessert because I filled out a Yelp review.  The dessert was pretty disappointing and not that tasty.  First of all the pastry was rock hard and impossible to eat using a spoon.  I had to ask for a knife to cut the pastry into bite-sized pieces. The dessert had a weird chalky texture.

Service was good as my waiter was friendly.  Overall it cost $60 for the appetizer, entrée, and free dessert.  I expected more in terms of quality given the abundance of good eating options around.",Gyrez6K8f1AyR7dzW9fvAw,2,9/4/2014,1,review,0,Westside,Home-Made Ice Cream

And luckily I'm enjoying it immensely thanks to Roaring Fork. Other foods I tried included the white bean soup (made with a pork base which made it pretty much delicious) and shrimp and grits. Were these any old grits you ask? Funny you ask because no is the answer. They were corn grits, which sounds odd and is mighty tasty.

The atmosphere here is warm and cabin-y. It seems like a great place to scoot in close to your date and get involved in a romantic dinner. Equally, I saw a few ladies groups there toasting each other with glasses of wine and sharing appetizers. It's one of those places that most groups don't feel out of place in.

Overall, I'd say this is a bit of an upscale place, but not so fancy that you have to save it for special occasions. Unless, you're like me and treat everyday like a special occasion. ;-)",j2bx_ctb_ED3zbfSaqhQmQ,4,11/26/2009,7,review,8,Centennial,Yummy China

Got the lunch special with teriyaki chicken. Didn't ask if it was here or to-go so they assumed to-go and chose the egg roll for me instead of the soup. Whatever. Judging by the other reviews they were doing me a favor.  

The chicken was overdone and almost chewy like when you microwave leftover fried chicken too long. The sauce tasted OK but was too runny and most of it was in a pool at the bottom of the chicken. 

Fried rice was uneventful. Not bad, just meh. 

The egg roll was disappointing. Just a paste inside of a crispy roll. Refused to soak any soy dripped in. The flavor was lacking. Was like a fried gruel roll. 

The lo mein was a disgrace. Overcooked noodles with no seasoning. So bland I could actually pick up the subtle notes of the tap water it was cooked in. In fact, it just tasted like solidified tap water. I used some of the sauce left over from the chicken with a bit of soy to add something to it but all it was like was diluting sauce with water.

While we were seated promptly at 6pm for our reservation there was nothing memorable about any part of our meal. The coconut shrimp app was...eh, ok.

I would have sent it back but we had tickets to a show that I didn't want to be late for. There was no seasoning to the meat and it was charred. The best part of the meal was the chop salad. My mom has a severe crab allergy and the meal she ordered came with a crab hash - so obviously she had to get something else in its place. To sub the crab hash for a basic mash cost $10 and it wasn't brought to our attention. I would have paid it regardless but it was the point that it showed up on the bill unannounced.  I then ordered the upside down apple pie and it tasted good but the presentation was pretty bad.

The restaurant had an upscale contemporary decor.  The servers were friendly, attentive, and informative.

For the appetizer, we tried the raw oysters.  I can't remember which ones we had exactly, but it was the one the waiter had said was plumper.  I have to say that the raw oysters were so delicious.  It was clean tasting and almost refreshing.  I wish there was more than four on the plate, because i wanted to keep eating.

For the entree, my friend and I shared two dishes.  We got the BBQ Salmon and the Pan-Roasted Gulf Flounder.  Both were very well cooked.  The salmon had bolder flavors, while the flounder was milder in flavor, but had a richer sauce.  It was almost too rich for me.  We also order a side of the Asparagus and Roasted Paquillo Peppers with Goat Cheese, which was perfectly cooked.

While I enjoyed all the things we order, none of it really stood out to me as super spectacular.  I guess I had high expectations for Emeril Lagasse to wow me, and he sort of didn't.  The best thing that night were the two raw oysters I ate.  

Perhaps we didn't choose the best dishes or perhaps this was not a restaurant that pushed flavors to the limit.  I'm not sure.  I would still recommend this restaurant though if you are looking for a solid menu to impress a date.",BjH8Xepc10i6OhCDQdX6og,4,7/24/2012,0,review,0,Eastside,Subway

But, we decided to try it anyway and sit outside next to the pool (close to the pool) since it was a nice day out. First off, the line was ridiculous, I'd say over 15 minutes, when clearly there were empty tables all around the restaurant. Grand Lux- 0-1 minute wait. We sat outside and the patio was a nice setting. However, the umbrellas which provided the shade had a lot of bird poop and although we wouldn't have minded the cute small birds, there were these hideous pigeons that were also flying around. But the main thing was the smoking. Apparently there was this couple sitting at an adjacent table smoking next to us. We had three small children. We asked if we could move. The hostess informed us that the entire outdoor patio allowed for smoking and if we didn't want to be around smokers that they could find us a table indoors. I was disappointed to know that they didn't even have a smoking section and a non-smoking section for the outdoor patio, which apparently they need because some people in the world have no regard, respect, or consideration, even for kids. If you want to kill yourself, don't kill other people while doing it. Smoking is a sick disease and smokers are addicts and are just compelled to behave in such a destructive way, its pathetic. Why would someone want to smoke a cig for breakfast is beyond me. You'd figure people at a high class place like the Wynn would be different. Guess not. This one is on Wynn for making the rules. Apparently rules are made for those who just don't know better. Since there are no rules here, we won't be returning. The service was good and the food was ok. Its not that hard to mess up scrambled eggs and toast or even chicken and waffles. Not gonna jeopardize my health or my kids because of some idiots and especially because a top hotel doesn't have rules to control their patron's behavior.

As in Nashville and other foodie cities, you line up at the counter, with a large printed menu on the wall to look at as you wait, then you place your order and choose your own seat.  They'll hand you your drinks on the spot and bring your food out when it's ready and usually, that's not too long.

I gave it 5 stars because the food is as good as it gets, but there is one notable flaw. The line is insanely long.   I wouldn't say Gaucho is to blame for such a long line (other than producing a hit restaurant) but they generally have exactly 1 person working the line/ringing people up even if nearly 100 people are waiting. Sometimes the same person gets all the drinks, takes all the orders, and rings each person up.  If a party of 4 pays separately and asks questions about the menu or for recommendations, you might wait 15 minutes for one table of people to place an order.  This makes the wait longer than necessary, even with Gaucho's great popularity. I can't think of another business where that flies.  

I can see that if they had more than one register, there might not be enough tables, but we've never been forced out without a seat but we have waited for over an hour to place our order... 

Keep up the excellent food, Gaucho.  You've already broken with tradition, but tweaking the way you take orders is in order.  No restaurant, no matter how lauded, is guaranteed permanent success and it's always a good move to consider your customers first.",u4sTiCzVeIHZY8OlaL346Q,5,5/6/2016,0,review,0,Westside,Chicago Brewing Company

We had been in the previous BBQ shop to grace this spot and enjoyed it so whenever I saw that a new one had opened up, we headed over to Brookline to give it a try.  The inside of the restaurant wasn't that much different than in its previous incarnation.  As soon as you walk in there is seating for about 20 or so people on the right with picnic plaid covering the tables and then there is a counter right in front of you.  Other than that this place has a cool feel to it as the walls have a distressed look and there are a number of older signs on the wall including a Coca-Cola sign that looks like it was used for target practice at one point in time.

For lunch I decided to order the special of the day which was the Sam and Ema brisket, pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich and for my side I decided on the mac and cheese.  My father ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich and at the last minute changed his side to the fries.  After only about a 10 minute wait, during which my father and I enjoyed watching the Price Is Right on the only TV in the restaurant, our food was brought out to us.  My meal came out first and the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was.  The sandwich was simply massive and I knew right away that it wasn't going to be easy to keep it on the bun.  That proved to be the only downfall of the sandwich as well because both the brisket and pulled pork were tender, moist and had a great smoky flavor to them.  The cole slaw was a nice addition as well as it gave the sandwich some extra moisture but that also caused the sandwich to collapse about half way through eating it and I ended up finishing it with my fork.

1) The food isn't very good
2) The service is awkward and timely
3) Sanitation is lacking, seriously ... 

Tbh, I was so excited to find not only Vietnamese food here in the Grand Canyon State and even more so when I found out there was one specialized in Hue cuisine. I've personally been to Hue in Vietnam and it does have it's own regional differences among the various regions and cities of Vietnam. The food here doesn't even come close to that kind of authenticity or quality.

I ordered the Banh Beo, Banh Xeo and Bun Bo Hue to try a few of the most common things to eat. 

Banh Beo- these little steamed rice cakes come in little sauce plates, topped with shredded shrimp and pork cracklings. It comes with a fish sauce for dipping. Their cakes were too thin, the shrimp garnish was pale and the cracklings were minimal. The sauce was way too diluted, but slightly sweet. 

Banh Xeo- some may call this a savory Vietnamese pancake or crepe. Made with a rice batter of coconut milk, rice flour and tumeric. Then stuff with pork slices, shrimp and bean sprouts. This dish really surprised me, the Banh Xeo was over cooked, greasy, too crunchy and tasted like bacon. The cashier even mentioned they were out of mushrooms for the Banh Xeo and that was questionable as it isn't supposed to have mushrooms in it at all. The Banh Xeo was overstuffed with bean sprouts, minimal pieces of pork and undercooked shrimp with tails still on. They didn't provide many herbs and one piece of lettuce came with it. Total let down.

Bun Bo Hue- a complex flavored, spicy noodle dish. This dish could use a bit more work, a bit diluted, broth needed more flavor and complexity. The only flavor I got from this dish was spiciness from the oils and broth. I had to garnish a lot of shrimp paste and lime to get this one to a decent level. Props to them putting pork blood cubes in, but the beef slices was so chewy and tough. The side dish with veg for this was lacking, a minuscule piece of lime, some banana blossoms and deteriorating basil. No balance in flavor and where's the lemongrass?

I was seriously upset not only emotionally, but my stomach hurt the whole time after!

Besides the poor flavor and quality of food, just poor sanitation all around. There were flies everywhere flying about my head, landing on the table, on the food! It was gross. You can even tell that there is poor sanitation by looking at the storefront, fridges and open kitchen. The cashier was very awkward, we paid him $100 and he said he would give us change when our food was served ... what? In between serving our food, he would also go back to a table eat some of his meal and head back in the kitchen to get the rest of our food, without hand washing to be seen.

The food was average.  I had the breaded umami chicken sandwich and it was over-the-top salty and a bit dry/rubbery.   My friends had the same comment about whatever it was they had.  The place was practically empty (maybe 3 total tables seated) but the service was a bit lacking.  When i ordered the chicken sandwich, server asked ""Do you want french fries or tater tots with that?"" So i said yes to the tater tots.  I had no idea until i got the check that there is a $2 add on for the tots (or fries).   The way the server presented it, it was as though it was included. Perhaps, ""Would you like to add a side to your sandwich for $2?"" would be better.  I did not need/want the extra side, i merely thought it came with and thus needed to choose which one i wanted.  

We had to keep asking our server for basic things (like glasses of water), server never asked how the food was, the wrong beer was presented and server did not know that until we waved the server back over and pointed out what the can said, then we sat idly waiting for server to appear so we could ask for the check when it had been apparent for a bit that we were done, then when the check came the server ghosted, and we had to bring the bill to the bartender to have him run the card.  We never did see the server again after the initial bill was dropped off.  No, thanks for coming in.  No, are you interested in desert... Nada.

This is great, except whenever the answer was no, he seemed upset and made a ""joking"" comment. It was very odd. Service was also very slow which I didn't understand because there wasn't much of a crowd there. It took about 10 minutes just to get more bread. 

As for the food - it was average for an Italian restaurant, so in my opinion, not worth the price. I had eggplant parm which was totally overcooked. The eggplant was pretty much mush, but the taste of the cheese and sauce was good. Oh I also had a chopped salad that would have been good but it was way over dressed. 

The general consensus around the table was that the food was good. But no one raved about it.

I might return to try some appetizers because they looked pretty tasty. But I definitely won't be back for a full meal.

One of the things I loved was that they gladly made me a pho that wasn't on the menu:  my favorite combination of chicken and shrimp.  Some places won't do that at all, and others skimp on one or the other.  Not here; both the chicken and the shrimp were bountiful.  They also didn't balk when we asked for extra jalapeno.  In addition, the decor of the place is very appealing, with none of that garish lighting and wretched music that plagues too many Oriental restaurants.

Firstly, they brought all of our tapas out at the same time. We have been to MANY tapas bars and they always bring the dishes as they are ready. We waited for a good 30 minutes before getting our dishes and they all came at the same time, which resulted in some being cold.

Secondly, the dishes were under-flavored. They were nowhere near the flavor profile that we have experienced from other Spanish restaurants.

We travel a lot and eat at varying places so I don't think our experience is biased in any way. We went on a Friday after checking into the hotel. Atmosphere was surgical-bright, quiet, and no one was there- think The Shining movie. Server was not bad, but not what you would expect with high end dining. Not that we were in a hurry but he was definitely on stoner time. All of which I can handle. But the food was so terrible we could barely eat it. We started with said 'millionaire' tacos which turned out to be some unknown miscellaneous fish that elicited a gag reflex. The tacos were soft but supposed to be crunchy and the whole thing smelled off. I would call these 25 cent tacos. Or stomach ache tacos. So we set those aside and ordered the seafood paella dish for two for the main meal - it's supposed to be a ceviche place! Unfortunately, we could not eat half of it. The mussels and clams were disgustingly inedible; so chewy and sandy. And it cost a fortune! I would understand paying for something good but this was like emptying the wallet for trash.

Since I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore and it was her first time visiting, I really wanted her to eat atop Mt. Washington. After speaking to my friends (who are hardcore foodies) and reading reviews on tripadviser and yelp, it became clear that Altius was the place to go. Making a reservation was painless and I asked for a window with a view since it was our anniversary. Making no guarantees, they said they would try their best to accommodate. 

When we arrived, the valet (I think it was $6-8) was polite and quick. Since we arrived about 15 minutes early, our table wasn't ready, but they did seat us in the bar. They had an excellent choice of wines, cocktails and craft beers. I ordered a wheat beer and my wife ordered a cocktail. The bartender gave us some crunchy snacks that were well-flavored. After five or so minutes we were seated along the window (as requested) and it was an AMAZING view. The maitre d' brought over our unfinished drinks as the server was brining their signature flavored popcorn appetizer (complimentary). 

For appetizers my wife ordered the oysters and I ordered a creative gourmet take on a caesar salad that utilized kale, thick cut bacon pieces, hand shaved fresh cheese, duck egg and fresh anchovies. Everything had proper texture, flavor and the portion sizes were just right. The oysters came with an angel hair, cucumber melody that was slightly sweet. A great compliment to the saltiness of the oyster. 

For the main course my wife had the duck duck goose, while I ordered lamb and pom frites. All the meat was savory, well-portioned and cooked to proper textures. While it came with sauce on the side, the infused seasoning and quality of the meats made them delicious and well enough to stand on their own. The duck, duck, goose was paired with polenta and kale. We also added a side of grilled asparagus that were done right. My rack of lamb had wonderful sautéed mushrooms, a garlic risotto and carrots to accompany, all of which were top notch. The added pom frites came with ketchup, aioli and a foie gras-based sauce. 

For desert, we coconut fruit plate and soufflé were outstanding. They were not overly rich or fatty tasting but fresh, light and just the right amount of sweetness to finish a meal. I also had a cup of the house coffee which was rich and flavorful. 

The service was wonderful. Our server was polite, moved quickly and made excellent wine recommendations. He also made sure our table always had enough free space and our water glassed full. The best touch of all? They surprised us with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate sauce on our dessert plate. We actually ended up staying about 20 minutes past closing (on accident) and not one time did we feel rushed or that the staff was annoyed. Very classy move by Altius.

The restroom was five star quality with artistic fixtures, scented candles and real hand towels. The overall decor was modern, minimalistic and clean. It was not old and stuffy like some of the other older restaurants on Mt. Washington. The crowd was relatively younger professionals but not too young.

Knowing what this restaurant has in store for special occasions, I made a prior reservation here and brought my parents to celebrate my mom's advance birthday after our first movie at the theater. We were quite the hungry Hannahs and contrary to our plan to share a couple of dishes, we picked an order each! 

Papa had the tenderloin tips served medium-well with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables presented in a decent portion for only $9.99. Meanwhile, mommy had the sandwich duo. This is a fun mix and match pickin'; you have a choice at half a sandwich (tuna albacore, cashew chicken, clubhouse, roasted turkey) with a side of either a salad or soup for only $7.99. She ordered the clubhouse with a side of potato cheddar soup (which was the bomb!) and an extra cesar salad which amounted to about $10 as well (not entirely sure about that) I, in turn, got myself the chopped steak. It's ground beef, almost bordering on thick beef patty, with a topping choice of either cheddar & tomato or glazed mushrooms and onions in burgundy sauce (I chose the latter) next to some mashed potato. I admit it was very filling, so much so I wasn't even able to take it all in. 

Before we ended, I buzzed our waiter a quick reminder about my mom's birthday and he came with their signature red velvet cupcake with a candle on top!

I saw a photo booth, foosball, shuffle board, table tennis, in addition to a rack of board games and dominos.

It was crowded and I didn't stay long, so I'll just rate the items I tried. The warm pretzels with beer cheese ($4) were excellent. I actually preferred these pretty pretzels to a similar item at Culinary Dropout. To drink, I ordered a Paloma ($10.) It's on the menu as a draft cocktail, but the bartender had to shake the tequila and grapefruit juice by hand, so maybe that tap's not ready yet. The drink was mostly ice. I saw plenty of beer, but no cider on the menu. They were playing really great music during my short visit.

i was on a business trip and ended up here based on yelp recomendations from my yelp peeps back home. it was a tuesday night, but the place was still pretty busy. i ordered the chorizo clams, grlled octopus, fries, and a sangria. PLENTY of food for one.  

the fries came out quick and the sangria was poured instantly. the octopus was excellent. the clams, well, had too much chorizo. or should i say, the chorizo didnt have enough clams. it was more of a chorizo dish than a clam dish. kind of overwhelming when expecting clams, but don't get me wrong, i'll order it again. 

overall bill was 30$ and i was stuffed. I ddnt finish the fries. id definitely go back, but would rather share the food with some company and get a chance to try more menu items...",5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg,4,2/12/2011,1,review,0,Eastside,PT's

Unfortunately on his last visit he had a problem with the lobster and returned it to the kitchen, then the manager apologized and said he would take it off the bill but never did. It took so long to get the waiter back over, he just paid and left. So it took some convincing to get him back in there. 
Sadly, the service was extremely slow (but it was courteous). We ordered a couple of steaks and some apps and it seemed like forever before they got to our table.  Bread bowl was pretty good, pretzel was a little dry. 
Steaks were over cooked, and I'm not a penny pincher, but if your going to be in the high end steak business you should know the difference between medium and well done (not pink at all throughout). They were bricks. They were also Luke warm which makes me think they sat under heat lamps for a bit. 
The bacon wrapped dates were off too. Half were burnt and the other half was ok. So I ate half of the apps and only the middle part of my ribeye steak. My buddy just sat and gloated... he didn't eat. 
I didn't complain because it took so long for the waiter to come by all I wanted to do was leave because I was still hungry. 
My buddy laughed at me and we went to Bottled Blonde for a pizza... which was really good by the way.

I went to the chef and asked to put less rise in my next order. To my surprise sushi came with visibly more rise. In my bill i found a charge of 8 dollars for wasted rice. Rude manager said it was her who advised the waiter to add the charge and that we were warned and if  i wanted to eat less rice i needed to order from a regular menu and refused to wave the extra fee, saying that she is sorry  , but has to protect the restaurant.

I had the creamy garlic butter with a house salad and the spicy aioli and the garlic fries. My boyfriend had on his fried tilapia the java sauce, creamed corn and edamame. The portions were really good as we will probably split it next time. We were both expecting different batter on the fish as the batter didn't have any seasoning and there was a lot of it on the fish. The sauce that was on my fish I thought was going to be more of a buttery sauce but it's like gravy! I didn't see that part on the menu when I ordered. Don't think I'll get that sauce again. My hot fish was sitting on my salad so it made my salad wilt. The fries were awesome and the salad that was not under the hot fish was good. I don't think we will get anything fried again as we didn't like the batter. My boyfriend didn't really rave about his lunch so I'm not sure how he felt about all of it as a whole.

My expectations were low, but I persevered. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which came with rice and a side of naan.

The curry was decent. Not very spicy and more on the bland side than I would prefer, but still ok. The rice was dry and overcooked. It was clearly sitting around a while so I avoided it. The naan was my favorite part of the meal. It was overly oily, but delicious. We were tempted to order an extra one for dipping, but decided against it.

My boyfriend and I went in on Christmas Day to eat in the bar area, but after realizing they offered an extremely limited menu, we asked for a table instead. We were told reservations only - understandable on Christmas. Out of curiosity, I checked OpenTable.com and saw that they had a reservation available for 2 in 15 minutes so I booked it. We closed out at the bar, and approached the snarky hostess with our confirmation in hand to be seated. She said that we weren't in her system and refused to seat us so we asked to speak with her manager. The manager, Lori Schleicher (could be misspelling - staff would not spell it for me) came to speak with us and immediately had a horrible attitude, treated us with disdain, and said that we had ""gotten a table in a roundabout way"" so we would not be served that evening. (WHAT?! Booking a table online is wrong??) She was incredibly curt and unapologetic, so we asked to speak with her manager. The gentleman who introduced himself as the Managing Director, Johnny Barnett, was not much better. He said that he understood there was a problem since we'd gotten a reservation while we were in the building and therefore would not honor our reservation. I stated that there was no provision on the website for a person's location or any requirements for the timing of when a reservation was made. We'd been allowed to reserve a table and should not be penalized for that if it wasn't supposed to be able to happen. He said that clearly someone had cancelled their reservation, which is why we were allowed to book, and when I pointed out that this indicates they have the capacity to serve us, he said that they overbook their reservations and count on people to cancel to get by. Unacceptable. NOT ONCE did they apologize or treat us with respect. We're repeat customers and have sent several friends and family their way. NEVER AGAIN. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THEY MARKED US AS NO SHOWS ON OPENTABLE AFTER REPEATEDLY INSISTING THAT OUR RESERVATION WAS NOT IN THEIR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. This prompted for me to get an email from OpenTable chastising me for not showing up when they were the ones that would not allow us to be seated. Ugh! Given the level that this establishment pretends to operate at, which is evident in their pricing, I would expect much, much better treatment and service.

Once I arrive I have to wait 5+ minutes to be sat because the host is off somewhere else. Then I'm sat and NO ONE comes to greet me, ask if I want something to drink or anything for 10 minutes! Finally a server on his way to drop off a guest check at the last remaining occupied table in my section stops and asks if I have been helped. I told him no and he takes my order and brings me back a water using lots of 'here you are beautiful'. He was the only saving grace of my visit but that was short lived because I overheard him telling his last table that his shift was over. 

I order the four piece fried chicken and it is brought out in about 12 minutes by a lady. No one comes back to check on me the entire time I'm eating. When I'm done I ask the food runner who I can get my check from and he says he'll let my server know. I find that interesting because 'I' don't even know who my server is. The lady who dropped off my food but never introduced herself or spoke to me drops off the check and asks if I want a box. I say yes. It then takes a little bit to get the box. As I get up to leave to go to the cashier she then yells out ""Thank you so much, have a nice day!"" as if she just remembered she wants a tip for her non-service.

So then I get to the cashier and it's a whole new barrel of monkeys. I hand the cashier my debit card and she says she needs my id for credit cards. I tell her I didn't bring it in my little wristlet because I didn't want to gamble and just came over for lunch. I say it's debit and I'll put in my pin. She says they don't have the machine and that I would need my ID.  I only left $8.79 in my wristlet and my check is $9.74 and I tell her again I didn't bring my license cause I walked and wasn't planning on gambling and just brought my debit card. I ask for a manager. She goes away, comes back and says the manager is busy but that it's their policy to need ID even for a debit card cause they are going to run it as credit and that I can go use the casino ATM. I tell her there is no way I'm taking out cash at a casino ATM and that there should have been a notice prior to a guest sitting down and eating in the restaurant that I would need id to use my debit card as that is not common practice to need one at restaurants. The large sign by the cash register only says you need id and room key if you are going to make a room charge. Seeing as how I'm at Tuscany eating and staying at The Westin that didn't apply to me. She then walks over to a small notice in small writing on the other side of the other register that says for credit cards you need id. Again I tell her that I brought by DEBIT card, and that little sign won't be seen by anyone, AND it would be seen after the fact. After someone has already eaten. I told her I'm trying to pay but I'm not using using their ATM and I only have $8.74 in cash on me and if the manager is too busy to come speak with a guest (I even showed her the copy of my work id that I have a pic of on my iphone that shows I'm airline crew which has helped many times at hotel front desks when I've locked my room key in my room and I need them to reissue me another one) then thatbis not my problem. Finally, she goes back to wherever she went before, comes back and takes the cash I do have and says next time bring ID, and I tell her there won't be a next time.

Between the horrible service, then the cashier incident, I would not go back to that place. The food was fine, but nothing special.

It's amazing how many people they can squeeze into this small space.  It's a bit claustrophobic but people will put up with a lot to get their taco fix. 

The menu is fairly sized and there's a bit of something for everyone, yes, even vegetarians.  The short rib taco was surprisingly the weakest as the meat was a bit tough and rather bland tasting.  The chorizo taco was expectantly much more flavorful but a tad chewy.  My favorites were easily the duck taco and seitan taco both for texture and taste.  These are small little tacos and you certainly don't feel guilty about eating them.  Think taco tapas.  

The seemingly major drinks were their margaritas.  I'm not a tequila fan at all so I pretty much steered away from those concoctions.  The beer menu, albeit tiny, was adequate.  There were some interesting martinis though (thanks to Kevin Sousa's influence I'm sure).  There is always hope found in the form of a well made libation. 

Service can be painfully slow in between tacos.  They obviously need more servers to deal with the crowds and a waiting area especially.  They don't take any reservations either so you're left to chance in scoring a table coming here.  Luckily, prices are relatively low to moderate.  I'm not sure if I'd come back again.

When you get in its hotter inside than it is outside and it does NOT smell good. I walked into the bigger room on the side where the the games are and it smelled like a cat was living back there! I ordered a chili dog and french fries with an iced tea. They put real shredded cheese on the chili dog not the artificial cheese and the french fries were crispy and tasted great with ranch. The food makes up for the poopy atmosphere and if you eat here make sure you place your order to go.,F_bksEGb8A9edatg_tBjbQ,4,9/3/2009,5,review,3,Southeast,Einstein Bros Bagels

My family needed something quick so we ordered a 24 piece hot wings and was advised it would be ready in 20 mins. When my husband showed up 18 mins later to pick up our order he was advised they had given our order away. He waited another 20 mins for them to make him another batch while asking to be compensated for their error for which they tried to give him a free soda after they JUST rang him up for 2 when he paid for the wings. After his wait they handed him his wings and we went home only to find out we were shorted HALF our wings. I called back up to Pizza Hut to speak with the manager. She explained my original order was never given away yet it was never made in the first place, she apologized for my short order, and offered to make me a whole new batch on the house. At that point I felt this location gained their stars back until today... 

Today we ordered yet another 24 piece wings and was given a 20 min wait. My husband goes to pick up order and was advised wings were never even made yet again for some odd reason. So the wait begins. He's given a $5 off next visit like others have mentioned. He's given his wings and this time hubby checks his wing count BEFORE he leaves and yet again he's short. The guy in the back laughs, says, ""oh really?"" and then picks up another container listed ""naked,"" adds sauce to them and hands them to my husband all while the guy next to him is paying for his ""naked"" requested wings. It makes me wonder how many people they short change on the wings that don't really complain. Let's be honest, if you short 8-12 wings off a 24 piece order, that's bold! I can only imagine what ordering a pizza would be like. And if people hate the service just that much, who cares how many $5 off your next order coupons you dish you because they won't be returning anyway!!!

Personally, I never cared for Ninh Kieu, I found their Bun Bo Hue to be too far too salty, I even suspect they used MSG in it. However, when the restaurant changed owners, I jetted over to see how Pho Ha Nam stacked up. 
For those that loved Ninh Kieu, you'll be happy to know not a whole lot has changed. The inside is largely the same, and a lot of the servers are still there. Their menu is a bit different however, it's definitely pared down, and prices are comparable to others in the area. The service was very fast and friendly. I was pleased to find I actually liked their Bun Bo Hue even more than Superior Pho's; while Superior uses a LOT of lemongrass in their bun bo, Pho Ha Nam's is definitely more spicy and oily, which is great if that's what you're after. They also add some variety with shredded radish and pate in the bun bo, which doesn't often come complimentary. My only criticisms are that there was a greater proportion of noodles to meat, which I personally don't mind, but others might feel the meat portion was a little small. I found with the addition of the pate though, it was a well balanced bowl. Unfortunately, they did not have tendon (my favorite noodle bowl add on) but otherwise I really enjoyed my meal here. My iced tea was complimentary, so I ended up walking out spending less than $10 (not including tip) for a very satisfying meal.

Although you will find this gem tightly packed even on any given weekday, it is more than worth it to squeeze your way in to the warmly decorated ambiance that is this little Vegas treasure. Try to get there with time to spare so you can sit outside and admire the lights and energy that make this city great. Not only are you welcomed immediately by the intoxicating smells of the kitchen, but as soon as you get the menu you are reassured that you have come to the right place! Extensive options include the must-try-at-least-once or twice the bacon-wrapped dates, the avocado gazpacho, roasted beet salad w/sherry vinaigrette, mushroom tart (gotta love mushies for this one), and last but not least, the veggie empanada! Do not leave this place without trying the empanada, meat or veggie, either will delight your taste-buds. 

Fast service, pleasant smiles on the servers faces even with a full house of hungry patrons, delicious veggie, meat and seafood options, and an affordable staple (at around $4-$9 a dish) to put on your list for any day of the week.

The Mexican food itself is decent and the prices are reasonable given how fancy the place looks. We ordered tacos and enchiladas, which came with sides of beans and rice. We weren't disappointed in our food at all but I guess we were hoping for something that would blow us away. Or maybe we're just spoiled by awesome quality Mexican food we can get back home?

The winners of the evening though were the margaritas. My partner ordered a classic and I picked out the watermelon. I was actually shocked that my drink came out refreshing and smooth tasting! I was expecting an overly sweet, super intense watermelon ""juice"" flavour that I've experienced in mixed drinks before, but this was very light and smooth and everything I've ever wanted in a drink that involves this fruit.

Hostess wasn't mean but not really friendly, doesn't seem to take much pleasure in her job.

We were a group of four seated at a very tight booth. We waited a good 10 minutes before anyone came. We were served water (tasted like tap) & told that our waitress would be right with us. ""Right with us"" really meant another 15 minutes before our waitress arrived. Our waitress Daisy apologized so we let it go but we were not enthusiastic about this experience anymore & we could tell our friends were getting annoyed but trying to keep it together since this was our first meet up.

My mother & I ordered the U.K. beer flight, fish & chips, & the British Ale Onion soup. Our friends ordered the fish & chips & beer flight as well. Food took about 20 minutes to arrive. The wait we could deal with but the actual food was a MAJOR disappointment. My soup was completely cold. It's winter... I wanted something that would warm me up... that obviously didn't happen. The fish & chips were cold too plus the chips were completely STALE. I have never been to a restaurant that has gotten fried potatoes wrong before... especially at the price of $30 per plate. It was a most unpleasant meal. My guess is that 
someone made it, they forgot about us, & the food was sitting there forever before the waitress was able to deliver it to us. I may have complained if we ever got a server to stop by. At the same time we were so over this experience that we just didn't even bother. 
Either way I don't feel like I should have to complain. 

I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. I've seen him rip people a new a**hole over stuff like this on T.V. on many shows so I definitely expected much more from his restaurant. I still would like to give his other restaurants a chance & hope for a better experience but I won't be coming here ever again.

There are different and unique flavors to choose from and they'll always be happy to give you samples to try.  The lady that helped us was so friendly and made different suggestions and had us trying different things.  We ultimately settled on:

1.  Rose Petal Gelato:  This wasn't too sweet but it definitely had a subtle hint of rose without being too strong.  

2.  Cookies & Cream Gelato:  You really can't go wrong with a classic flavor whether it's your regular ice cream or even gelato, right?

3.  Chocolate Sorbetto:  Yes, as I had already mentioned earlier, this is amazing.  If you're a fan of chocolate, you should get this and try it for yourself.

Let me first start off by saying that I went to Yayo's a week ago and they are now CLOSED.  Everything was packed up-no sign or life could be seen in the restaurant.  I tried calling the place but the phone just rang and rang.

I am not sure why they closed but it could be the fact that there was no one ever in the place when my bf and I went there.  I was surprised by the lack of patrons on our previous visits since it was so close to UNLV.  I literally cried myself to sleep b/c they have the most delicious street tacos ever!  

Ambience/Service:
You order at the counter and pay.  It is very reasonably priced.  $2-$4 a taco depending on if  classico or loco tacos are ordered.  The sodas are canned 12 oz and they will give you a plastic cup of ice if you ask.  You then take a seat at one of their many tables. They are all big wood tables and benches that back to other tables.  So if you want privacy or elbow room, then you won't get any...but again we were there when no one else was and had the place to ourselves.  The food comes out pretty quickly.

Food:
Now back to my review of the food in case they ever reopen...

As I have said, I have been there a handful of times and tried most of the meat tacos.  My bf tried the shrimp tempura taco since I don't eat seafood.  Here's a rundown of the tacos we've had:

Carne Molida- hands down the best taco for me.  This is their crown jewel!  It is a finely ground beef taco with a roasted bell pepper balsamic crudo.  You would never think that this would belong in a Mexican dish and I was really skeptical b/c balsamic vinegar can be very acidic.  However, it was delicious. I could eat it everyday and I am not joking!!!

Carne Asada- just ok.  Nothing was special about it. On one occasion, the meat was very burnt b/c they had left the tray on the burner too long I believe.  I brought the taco to gentleman that had taken our order to let him know it was burned.  He politely took it from me and asked if he could taste it.  I said yes, of course and he apologized when he realized it was in fact burned.  He replaced it with another taco of my choosing.  

Camarones- my bf said he thought it was pretty good and that the shrimp was not battered to heavily and it was not soggy.  He said he would probably stick with the fish taco instead.

Pescado- my bf had this and said that the fish tasted fresh and the slaw on top was good.  Nothing really stood out but it wasn't bad either.

Carnitas- pretty amazing and they added pineapple salsa.  The meat was not fatty at all (some people like that but I don't).  The meat was also finely shredded, which I prefer.  

Texano- again just ok. Not something I would order again.

Sicilian- great! Chicken with pesto and the red bell pepper crudo...again, you think that this has no place in a taco but it was excellent! I would order this again.

Bombay- I am not crazy about Indian food but I found that curry flavor to be very mild.  My bf on the other hand loves Indian food and thought it was a great taco.

Shanghai- Again, I am not crazy about ethnic food but it was still delicious and I would not turn my nose up at this if someone presented it to me.  The wasabi crema was very mild and it was not spicy at all...and that's coming from a wuss that can't handle spicy foods.

Sides- we only ever got the chips and salsa.  The chips appear to be made in house are thick and served with a pico de gallo salsa.  They don't give you a ton of chips but I still think they are more filling than thin ones.  They do serve other sides like black rice and beans but I never got a chance to try them:(


So sad that they are now closed but I hope that they will reopen soon.",yGCrsq0AYI8WN7goMVLHJA,5,7/9/2013,1,review,0,Other,N9NE Steakhouse

Located right of the Summerlin Pkwy and Buffalo, this little place has a facade of no thrills but oh what a surprise you get. The menu is small but the food you receive is probably one of the best. The place has only a few tables and a bit of a funky smell, like it used to be a chinese take-out or something, but don't let that distract you. After ordering you notice that the service is extremely quick, like McDonald's quick, (I went on a Monday night around 8pm) and the little salsa bar with their different condiments is concise with pico de gallo, fresh cut wedges of limes, a green chile sauce, and a rich red chili sauce. I ordered the carne asada burrito and the five pack soft tacos with carnitas, carne asada, and lengua. All I decided to take them home to enjoy and what a surprise it was. Each and every one of the tacos were still soft and tender. The meats, no matter if it was the asada, carnitas, or lengua, had a slight roasted smoky flavor with a little kick. It didn't take me long to devour all the tacos. Next it was onto the carne asada burrito. All I can say is wow!

Like Raku down the street, Ichiza is the kind of place you'd never expect to find in Vegas...and generally filled with the kind of people (young Asians) you'd be surprised to find here in plentitude. If it isn't ""authentic,"" it certainly feels that way--on the second floor of a post-trendy strip mall with little else to attract you (though Zizzy karaoke bar downstairs has its charms). 

Yes, there is a general standard sushi--ramen-robotayaki menu here, but that isn't what you should come for. What you should come for are the random daily specials that are posted on pieces of paper all over the walls, which could be...just about anything edible! Come to experiment, come to be daring, come to have fun. Service is friendly, by cute Japanese girls, though it's not necessarily helpful. I wouldn't necessarily recommend those with food allergies take their chances here.

Oh, wait.  The term, ""never again"" commonly refers to the holocaust, not this restaurant.  But seriously...

One night, I thought, what the hell, pizza from the best, right?  Pizza Margarita, $10-$15.  So I go, and I ask, ""...can you add sausage and mushroom?"", and the guy says sure.  I'm not kidding you: $5 DOLLARS FOR SAUSAGE, $3 FOR MUSHROOMS...ON A $10 PIZZA.

I checked two pizza parlors, at random, who have owners without Chrissy Bianco's ego, and for an 18"" pizza, to add sausage, they charge $1.75.  A dollar seventy five!  But not Bianco!  FIVE DOLLARS!  

Listen, I've made money, had money, lost money; it's my opinion that $5 for sausage on a 10-12"" pizza is pure narcissism.  It's just silly.  And I'll never, EVER come back. 
$5 for sausage, you jagwod!  Take your sopressata and leave me alone!

We got there around 10:30 on a Friday night, and it was packed in that huge restaurant! Luckily, no long pho Kim wait for us, and we were seated within minutes. 

One aspect of this pho joint that stood out from any other pho place I've been to is their excellent service. Everyone that came by was so friendly, even though the restaurant was packed and busy. Usually I feel like I'm always being rushed, but never did we feel like they were trying to turn tables like a mother pho'cker. 

My wife and I both got the rare beef pho and an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls weren't the greatest, but the rare beef pho was pretty pho'ckin good (probably tasted better cuz we were super hungry and haven't had pho in awhile). The broth was also pretty hearty and flavorful.

Sports bar vibe and decent food. 

Had the Upper Trio pizza. Meats were of good quality. I'm picky about meatballs and sausage, and this place delivered. I'll try the meatball sliders next time. The crust was a melt on your mouth Brooklyn-style with a dusting of corn meal on the semolina. 

We also had smoked wings. They were similar to those from Wild Game, so we were pleased. Sauce was mediocre, but since the smoked wings were good, the sauce mattered minimally. And since they're smoked, they were thoroughly cooked

- Tum yum roll.  It was shrimp tempura with avocado and cilantro, wrapped in spring roll wrap, topped with sriracha sauce.  It was a little weird but but still tasty.

Service: 
the service overall was good but nothing special.  I would expect top notch service at a 3 star Michelin restaurant at this caliber.  however, I do have a complaint, the restaurant should offer dark linen for guests wearing dark clothing and white linen for guests wearing lighter color clothing.  I've seen this done at some of the restaurants in LA and I really appreciated the attention to detail down to the color of the linen.  I definitely don't want to get white lint stuck on my black dress or suit.  Secondly, the waiter's and waitress's attire is a little outdated ( especially the waiter's suits don't seem to fit very well and are very old fashion).  Although what they wear really has nothing to do with my meal or the service that I receive, I just think their outfit needs to match the whole posh/chic/upscale atmosphere. Finally, because we were there for our anniversary , my husband had ordered a special celebratory cake for us to share.  The waiter brought the cake out on a nicely decorated tray with a pretty sugar piece and a sign that says "" happy anniversary.""   the issue here is that he brought it out and left so quickly I didn't even get a chance to take a pic of it.  He quickly showed it to me, then turned it over to show it to my husband and that was that.  Didn't offer to wait for me to take a picture of the whole tray.  The whole experience with the tray felt very very rushed.  We each got a slice of the cake and in my mind, I thought I get to take the rest of the cake home.  but I guess not, cuz they didn't pack the rest for us.

Food:
The food was Ok.  I've had better.  Like the previous reviewer had stated, if you're in LA, you'll probably enjoy Melisse more.  We ended up spending more than we should have.  I was not impressed with the food.  we had the 5 course tasting menu but we get to try more than 5 courses because my husband and I chose different things on the menu ( you get to choose 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert from a list).  so in actuality, I get to try 10 different items that night, and NONE impressed me.  I  thought the food was either too salty or too bland.  Most of the dishes had similar jelly type of consistency.  even the soup had a weird thick consistency that I don't care for.  everyone on here complimented on the bread cart.  but I don't think it's worth it to spend a sh'tload of money just to chow down on the breads.  there were 8 choices of bread to choose from.  I tasted every one of them based on the views on here but I find them nothing special.  you can get really good bread elsewhere and pay a fraction of the price.  They also have a mini dessert cart to end your meal.  Ok, anyone that knows me , know that I have a sweet tooth and I know my desserts...BUT the dessert cart had nothing that I really like.  the macarons were just OK ( Lette's or Bottega Louie is WAY better).  mini operas and cupcakes were BLEH...gosh it was the most pathetic dessert cart I've ever seen in my entire career of eating sweets.

Last words:

SAVE YOUR MONEY.  if you're in LA, try Melisse or Providence.  Both are really really good and local! I think they should downgrade this restaurant to a 1 star or a no star restaurant.",XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,2,7/26/2014,4,review,0,Spring Valley,Angara Indian Spice Grill

On the morning I make it in I showed it to one lady and she responds, ""Oh yeah no problem, order your sandwich here and your drink at the register.""  So I order my sandwich, bacon, egg and cheddar on an Everything bagle and move up to the register to order my chai.  
I hand the girl at the register my coupon too and in a whiney-sigh calls for the manager.  The manager comes to the counter and proceeds to tell me that they are a franchise and do not accept corporate coupons. 
HUH?!
To which I replied, slightly annoyed, ""F*ck it I just ordered the sandwich give me my chai and I'll pay.""  ...$9....it hit a bit hard for breakfast since I was only looking to spend $4-$5.

I have only been there after 7pm and have not had the same experience as those other reviews.  This is a great place to hang out.  You can create your own experience here.  You can choose to keep it light with a game of ping pong or cornhole and a couple of ""paperbag specials"" with the buds, sit around a fire pit and watch a game or if that is not your thing choose to sit at the bar inside or catch a table inside Culinary Dropout.  Either way CD food is served whether or not you choose to sit inside the restaurants or one of the Yard tables. 

Remember this area is still just a large covered outdoor patio and even with heaters on a chilly night you may still need a sweater. Or conversely in the summer it can get a little warm through here.  But it is not as hot/cold as it is outside the Yard walls.  

Don't let the fact that all the parking is Complementary Valet deter you. [Or the fact the line extends into the street during peak hours] Don't risk trying to park in the neighborhood as the homeowners are diligent about getting folks towed.  Just let the valet dudes do their thing, you go do your thing and tip 'em when your night is through. 

There is a lot of space inside the complex, which includes Miss Cleo's Seafood.  But if you are like me there can be a personal tipping point on the crowd level and have yet to stay after 10:30ish on a Thurs/Fri/Sat.",8-_jXGGDFPFAPB4r1x-81w,4,1/10/2014,4,review,1,Spring Valley,Harold's Chicken & Fish

In the phone, the woman taking my order proceeded to give me a cooking lesson on how my rare burger might not be so rare when I get it home due to the cooking process. Are you kidding? I've cooked a few things in my day.

So, I arrive to pick up my order. I get a one-finger gesture over to the bar, where to-go orders are procesed. What a joke. There are a few dozen post-work drinkers in there, so I am promptly ignored for a while. One may think it easier to pick up at the hostess stand? There I go thinking again!  I then pay for my order with whom I can only assume is a manager. I then ask if I can have a few ranch. He passes the request to the bartender.

My name is called after a few awkward minutes trying to find a less intrusive place to stand. As I get my bag, I verbally verify that there are a few ranch in the bag. She says there are. Stupid me for not looking. Get home: nothing.  Beyond aggravated.

The burger was ok. The mozzarella sticks were excellent. Would have been better with ranch. Doh. A side salad of just lettuce cost an extra $1.75. Ridiculous. Not a pleasant experience. I don't know why I expected better.

Update this morning: GM Debbie contacted me for a follow-up, which was nice to see that they care about bettering customer service.

59345,2,b2Fo861ls3E0HJxGupIXsA,VXqyMBNsPV280KKU6UrNRg,"When a friend told me about a secret pizza place we should check out in Cosmopolitan, my first inclination was to Yelp it.  Not so secret with 3200 Yelp Reviews, I thought.  Whether its for pure marketing strategy or for a nobler cause of filtering the unworthy from pure pizza aficionados, we didn't really care.  We just wanted a good pizza.

So off we went to the overly modern, sparkling Cosmopolitan Hotel on a Friday night with the street roaming masses in search of their famed New York style pizza.  Despite having looked it up, it still took two asks on two floors to find the spot.  Both staff members seemed well prepared for the question and soon we were walking down a narrow hallway decorated with records I'm pretty sure even my parents were too hip to listen to.  

The first thing I saw entering was the video game Galaga from the 80s and a couple of pinball machines in a very small square room with no tables and chairs and a busy counter to order from.  Gratification was quick as we moved with the line.  They had four different pizzas ready to serve: cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and peppers. And basically if you want more topping, they just grab one of these and add whatever topping you want to add.  So it makes it quick.  

The pizza.  Oh the pizza was quite good.  So good that despite my low carb obsession of late, rules had to be broken and I asked for more.  More. More.  Ingredients were quality despite the low price.  As the noise, decor, and the visual overload of a very diverse group of customers nearly tested my sanity- the gooey, greasy, meaty goodness of this pizza blocked it all out for me.

We put together a few small plates/snacks to share - pimento cheese (our deeelicious favorite), bacon jam (good, but really just chopped up bacon; Tapas 51's is better), house chips (tasty), and crab pups (fine but small).

No pepper, garlic, olive oil, or herbs in the sauce. Yet with the complete absence of seasoning, it was packed with salt. Also had the frittata which was had a nice texture and eggs were cooked perfectly. However, again, lacked seasoning.  I asked for ketchup and tabasco and mixed it together for a spicy ketchup that saved the dish.

As though they are doing us lowly soft drink partakers a favor by sinking to our level. Yet, when pressed, they still wouldn't reveal whether their ""cola"" was Coke, Pespi, or something else (some of us care, yo). 

We only came here because we won a $50 gift card, and I would never come back. The hostess was nice, but the service ended there. Our server was snippy, looked angry the whole time, screwed up our drinks twice, then snapped at us when we tried to correct her. Our pizza was only barely cut, we mostly had to rip it apart ourselves, and the busboy kept trying to take our plates before we were done and without asking. 

The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory, but not very good in practice. There were very few options in the way of regular pizza if you didn't want to try one of their many ""theme"" pizzas (bbq chicken pizza, pasta pizza, enchilada pizza, etc). We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza, which was tough and undercooked, and the ""Meaty Meaty"" pizza, which was okay, but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza.

Coming here on a rainy Friday night, we grabbed a valet to park our car. Given an umbrella and went inside. Nice fancy looking restaurant. More open with 2 floors and lots of glass windows as opposed to your standard boys club stuffy wall street steakhouses.   Not to say anything is wrong with that but a nice change of pace. We were brought to a table on the second floor and this is pretty much when things started looking real good. Waitress was top notch, service friendly, attentive without being pushy. Explained everything on the menu, including the degree of redness in the cut when asking for medium rare which some ppl might take as offensive if they know their steak and assume it's an insult to their knowledge. I, however, think it's a nice attention to detail and being to many steakhouses, I know that medium rares vary widely from place to place even though they shouldn't and it's good to know right off the bat they are going to bring you what you want.  The specials at this place are insane! Prix fixe power couple special is 99 for 2 ppl for salad, filet mignon plus crab cake, a side and dessert! And my favorite cut being ribeye for it's flavor I was able to substitute a 12 oz ribeye for an 8 oz filet mignon for no extra charge. Hell yeah! Also it being Friday night, there was a half off bottle special (on select bottles of course) and half off glasses of wine. That is just too great. Most of the time specials are saved for weekday nights when business is slow but a Friday night? Unheard of. Food was great. Caesar salad was tossed very well and everyone knows a good toss is needed. Ribeye was flavorful and cooked to perfection. When it was brought out they asked us to cut into it to assure it was cooked to our liking before walking away. I have seen this done at some steakhouses but not all high end steakhouses and it's always appreciated especially since we had 4 steaks and all were cooked to the right temp already.   No sauce on the table meaning they expect the steak to stand on its own.  Dessert was good, my father in laws bday so they hooked him up with a dessert. Another high point was that they didn't get him just a pre selected standard dessert but let him choose off the regular dessert menu and it came out with a candle and everything with a standard happy bday and no embarrassing scene.

1.) Risotto and mushrooms - it wasn't all that great. Not cooked to how I like it. A little too gritty for my taste. 
2.) Mussels in butter sauce - I was very impressed with the overall taste. The mussels were soft, and the wine and butter sauce prepared with it made the dish perfect. 
3.) Steak - WOW! The tenderness and seasoning gave it a lasting impression in my mind. 
4.) Salad - I could have more if it was bottomless. 
5.) snails - YUMMMMMM-O. I couldn't get enough of it. 

Our server was really nice and patient with us. Only downfall as to why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the food took waaaay long to prepare. I guess it gave us girls time to talk and laugh.",HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw,4,4/15/2011,1,review,1,Westside,David Burke

I purchased a lunch Groupon for 65$ for two with the unlimited surf and turf + mimosas. 

When walked in, there was a 5-10 min wait. No biggie. We were then seated in a crowded room with 2 servers. 

The busser that walked by us filled up all four glasses of water on the table when there was only 2 of us and didn't clear away the other place settings. Annoying but I brushed it off.

I asked for our drinks from the server, busser, and finally a manager. 20 mins later we got our mimosas. 

The meats that came around were very rare in the middle, unlike last time when they were more well done. That knocked more points off for us, but for others that may be a plus. 

I repeatedly asked for the ""surf"" portion of our meal and we finally got it in the end after at least an hour.

The dessert was fantastic... probably the best of everything at least.

70150,1,O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,6FVKr98E8vbOSeCi31fYHA,"I arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. I mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn't stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did I want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. When the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.

As soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the Restaurant Week menu. As that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.

We also noticed a birthday card from the staff. Details, people, details!

Getting to the good stuff (well, mostly):

Duck-fat Fries (3.5/5) - The truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. The herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, STRIPSTEAK!). The last one, I can't remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don't like mustard). 

Foie Gras Sliders (1.5/5) - Ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the grilled foie gras they list as an extra. We were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. OK, we thought, we'll try it. Spoiler alert! It was still a single piece, just sliced in half. This made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. The bread (I tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. The garnishes were OK. A single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. Overall, high hopes dashed.

Duck Spring Rolls (3.5/5) - Generous portion and, I was happily surprised, not too heavy. The wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. Again, however, it was not heavy. The crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. The meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. It was a bit dry in spots. I am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.

Heirloom Tomato Salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - Fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn't weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.

NY Strip (4/5) - Slightly overcooked based on our order. We were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. The sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.

Roasted Chicken (4/5) - A tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. I love that they left the skin on; I don't eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. The truffled mac n' cheese (4/5) was really good. Almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it's own amazing profile.

Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Biegnets (5/5) - The brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. The biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. Another detail we thought was fantastic, sis's dessert came out presented with the words Happy Birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!

Wines (5/5, nail on the head every time). We started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of Gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish Oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. We spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked AND what we ordered). Given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.

The service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. There were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. 

All in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.

With the Restaurant Week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional foie gras, our total was $300 and change. Bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!",pKk7jCFIm96qDdk0laVT2w,4,9/8/2011,1,review,1,Other,Mariscos El Puerto

They gave accurate waiting times, 10 minutes, to everyone that was there.

The service was fantastic, they were busy, but both our waiter and person serving water was around twice as much as you'd find in most Mexican restaurants that charge twice as much.

A previous poster said the salsa was good.  I agree.  It comes out with hot and mild, or mix it for a good combination of both.

The dishes were well proportioned and authentic - I didn't get the usual velveeta cheese taste like you will at chain Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the #1 combo which came out with great beans and rice.  Throw in some of that hot salsa on there and you can't miss!

We walked in and the design is so pretty! There was no wait so we were seated right away and at once all of their staff greeted us (super awesome!!). They greet each guest that arrives and it just kicks off a great first impression. 

We opted for the Takoyaki as an appetizer, which is a popular Japanese dish made of octopus balls with bonito flakes (fish flakes that move!!) I've seen this dish in maybe 3 other restaurant I've ever gone to and this was finally my chance to try it. We enjoyed it, but felt like something was missing. Still a good experience tho!!

I feel like I might've enjoyed the thick noodles better. The broth was not as rich as I anticipated for. I've had richer broth before - this just had something missing. I had to then add extra sauce and seasoning to it to reach my liking. Nonetheless I did end up enjoying my bowl and it filled me up super quick I had to make my BF finish the rest for me!

I ordered (so typical of me) their supersomethinggooey chimichanga. You may as well have brought me a pile of flaming poo. It looked so unappetizing when it was plunked down in front of me. You know when you were a kid and you were forced to eat something you hated and you did all you could to prolong the agony? Well, there were no potted plants within range for me to dump my food in and the napkins were so flimsy I couldn't spit my bites out gracefully. Instead, I pushed away the food and claimed, ""I savored every bite and now I'm full.  I'll take it home."" My friend loves that place. Why? I can't understand it, either. I dumped the leftovers off in the trash at the Taco Bell I ended up at.

Their pad thai is my favorite dish, although when you're there, ask for ""spicy noodles"", as that's what they call it.

My office frequented Jimmy Johns for a while often times making the few blocks walk down Charleston Blvd for lunch. Then we started ordering online and having it delivered. Partly we did it because we're lazy. Partly because it is quick and easy. And there is no outrageous delivery fee. We were so saddened by the closing of this store. I saw they were remodeling and that provided us with some glimmer of hope. But it seemed so long between the closing and the eventual re-opening. It was disheartening to say the least. Nevertheless they did open the doors once again and we have resumed our ordering of their sandwich masterpieces. Recently I took my dad in for his first Jimmy Johns experience. I've got him hooked now. We both got the same sandwich. A Jimmy Johns Gargantuan with all the fixings including hot peppers. The roast beef, turkey, salami, tomatoes, lettuce, onion etc all crammed into the chewey bread is a hard sandwich to beat. And with the new expanded store it is a pleasure to dine in now. The previous version was small and cramped beyond and reasonable comfort level. The new version 2.0 of this location is more open and inviting.

I prefer this location to the one on the strip because you can save 20% off your entire bill by visiting the Miracle Mile concierge and getting a coupon book (officially, it's for any AAA member).  And yes, it's also good on the margaritas!  

Disappointed that they no longer offer comp chips and salsa but their food is much better than Cabo Wabo's.

The server came around pretty quickly once we were seated. Our server, though, was not particularly helpful. When I asked her what were the best dishes (her recommendation) she just pointed to the the three biggest pictures on the menu without much explanation. 

I ordered the Jinya No3 with extra ground pork and fresh garlic. The Jinya No3 was great as the broth was not too thick like some ramens are. The fresh garlic was a nice touch. It just comes out in bulbs and they hand you the press and you can press it in yourself, which was nice. I don't think the ground pork added much to the ramen, however. For some reason, it didn't have a fresh taste. Maybe a little old.

Friends of ours had ordered spicy ramen with extra noodles. Their dish came out and it didn't look spicy at all (just plain yellow broth). When they asked the server if it was spicy, she wasn't sure herself. She didn't check either. She just assumed it was. She also had to be reminded to bring extra noodles.

Buddy Valastro

A good thing happened to my wife and I. We were driving down Las Vegas Boulevard and were trying to decide where we wanted to eat lunch.

Heart Attack Grill ? Been there, done that. Please see review.
Carson Kitchen ? Been there, done. Please see review.
Lagasse's Stadium? Been there, done that as well. Please see review.

Lola's Louisiana Kitchen?
Rock N Noodles?
Grimaldi's Pizzeria?  
Been... there... done... that...
Please... See... Review.

Long story short, we found Buddy V's Ristorante and we enjoyed it a lot!
I ate a Hoboken Cheesesteak. I love cheesesteak, but have never been to Hoboken. I'm not really sure what Hoboken would taste like? But the sandwich was delicious.

My wife ate a Chicken BLT and said her's was delicious as well. 
Service was spectacular. Our server, Danny was one of the best we have had along Las Vegas Boulevard. If you don't believe me please see my review for Mon Abi Gabi. 

The bill was under $40.00! But then again that was without alcohol. That's right it is possible to eat on Las Vegas Boulevard and not consume alcohol!

I have two concerns about Buddy V's Ristorante. One, the bakery across the hallway is over the top and smells addicting. Two, there is a kid's menu, but I have a feeling, Buddy V's Ristorante would not be good for kids in the later hours of the day. Lunch or early dinner, sure. 

Great Place. Great Service. In closing I would like to suggest reading my review for Buddy V's Ristorante... but you just did.",nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,5,2/14/2016,0,review,0,Downtown,Tacos Estephanie

The atmosphere was awful and colored my whole entire meal.  Firstly, it was *hot*.  We visited in March and had on blouses and pants.  Nothing very heavy.  And we were both sweating for most of the meal.  I think the windows were open, but in the back part of the restaurant it was hot, with no cool air.
Sitting down you are overwhelmed by the table setting.  So much on the table!  Nearly everyone managed to knock over the bread knife balanced on edge when they sat down.  It makes a big clatter.  Then the waiter shows up with multiple menus, an iPad, a cheesy ""tasting"" menu you enticed to order so you can have an autographed photograph of Giada.  I had approximately 5 different things to look at.  And no room to put them anywhere on the table.  Some of the menus were redundant.  But I had no idea which one was the actual menu and had to ask.
The food was, meh. The bread was the highlight.  We had stuffed dates, grilled baby peppers and a nice lemony salad that was dressed perfectly.  All of these were tasty, but nothing special.  We had lobster ravioli which was bad.  The pasta was mushy and a little gooey without much filling.  It was placed over large chunks of greens, which were impossible to eat with the gooey pasta.  I was shocked the pasta would be so awful.
But the timing of the food was awful.  Almost 1 minute after ordering, food started coming out and being shoved onto our very tiny, overdressed table.  Oftentimes, the waiter would stand awkwardly with the plate while we tried to move stuff around to make room to squeeze it in.  I think we had 3 plates brought out within 5 minutes of ordering.  I had to have them hold the salad because, well, there was no room and we were still working on the first two plates.

I have picked up from here many times, there is always a different person running the show are that individual has never been very personable.

They do not deliver, so dine-in and carry-out are your only options.  Definitely call ahead and time your drive to arrive at the restaurant after your pizza is ready. Get your pizza and get out! That is my advice.

When we arrived, we were politely greatest and told it would be just a moment for our table to be ready. There is a photo booth tucked away to the left of the hostess stand, cute touch. Another hostess came over to escort is to our table. When we entered she pointed out that Giada was next to the antipasti station and asked of we would like to take a photo with her. Sure, why not?! We waited while she was talking to another group and when they were finished our hostess told her we would like to take a picture. She was very abrupt and said that she couldn't have people gathering in the front because it was blocking the entrance. Ok, I get it. But it made us feel like we did something wrong when we didn't even ask to take a photo with her, we thought it was part of the grand opening experience. She said she would come by our table instead, but never did despite visiting many other tables around us. The hostess then gave us a little ""tour "" and lead us to our table. Beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.

We ordered the Giada and Flash cocktails, both good, but took forever to come from the bar. The waiter even came by multiple times to tell us they were coming. As for the food, we elected for the tasting menu $120. Probably not the best choice. The antipasti was ""Gilda's Favorites"" and they were just ok. The grilled octopus (dietary substitution) was over cooked. We added the chicken Marsala meatballs, but they never came. The lemon spaghetti was by far the best dish of the night. The pea tortellini was excellent as well. My husband had the lamb and loved it, as well as the corn side dish. I had the salmon and it was ok. No different from any other pan seared salmon at most other restaurants in the strip. The smashed potatoes, were not all that ""smashed"", had good flavor. Again just ok.

Dessert was excellent. PB&J tiramisu (not really anything like a tiramisu though), chocolate chip cookie (served warm), lemon cookie (tart, but a little too sweet), chocolate cake (rich, but delish), and gelato (coffee was the best!). We were supposed to get a signed copy of the tasting menu, but our server forgot to bring it out. We were on our way home before we realized it and my husband had turn around to go back and get it.

I also had the Barbarella and my husband had a glass of wine. In total over $400 for the two of us, and in my opinion not worth it given the other high quality options on the strip. Wait a few weeks and they'll start serving lunch. I'd bet you'd get many of the best dishes at a fraction of the price.

It's pretty close, though. And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.

We started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.

A few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.

Beyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today.",9a3DrZvpYxVs3k_qwlCNSw,5,8/6/2011,4,review,3,Spring Valley,McDonald's

This meal, to me, was the perfect blend of my favorite stuff: grilled boneless chicken kabob, perfectly seasoned rice and awesome salad. We even braved the terrible service of the girl who used to answer the phone (she was very rude) to come and get this food!

However, at some point they decided to change things around. The rice is now more brown and doesn't have the same perfect taste. The cheese even changed momentarily from feta to mozzarella. I love cheese but I loved feta in this setting more so the change was annoying to me. By far, though, the rice change realllllly got me. It got me so much that I stopped eating here.

Then, I decided to give it another try. To my surprise, the rice was ALMOST back to what it used to be. I was temporarily happy again!! Until, several weeks later, another craving hit and I went back to get takeout and I was given the type of rice that I hate. This ruined the entire meal for me. I actually have not been back again since because I can't figure out what kind of rice they are using on the regular.

In any case, despite my rice saga, the owner is usually very nice when I see him. He recognizes some members of my family and says hi and that is nice also. I do hope the restaurant does well and maybe one day I'll be back (maybe).",l_jQTJ0Y5GC7_xr7dpiOeQ,3,4/16/2012,1,review,0,Other,Feast Buffet

I understand that when I got there that it was pretty late, but the place wasn't empty and about to close, so I DO expect good service.  First of all it took waaaay too long to get anyone to notice that we had sat down at one of thieir booths.  Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn't tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.  The manager i think he was, couldn't stop being a huge douche about the fact that I was the only underage person there.  He went out of his way to come by our table and say, oh yeah your waitress asked if I had checked your IDs before when you came to the bar for a drink, so I made sure to let her know that you (points) at me, were the underage one.  Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.

When we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his ""work area"".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.

Now to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn't have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn't get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, ""need anything else?"" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny's and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.

Let it be known, we're in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you're lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good.",-01XupAWZEXbdNbxNg5mEg,1,10/30/2009,5,review,4,Westside,Little Caesars Pizza

A hole in the wall pizza counter in a chic, upscale hotel with no advertising or signage anywhere on the property, that provides a relatively quick and affordable (by Vegas standards) lunch or snack. You could easily walk right by without knowing it's there....secret! They typically have 4 or 5 pizzas to choose your slice from ($6/slice) or you can order a whole pizza.

There are only a few counter seats, so most people take it out in the seating area on the 3rd floor or back to your room.

I tried a variety of the slices during my stay, but the simple white pizza slice was the best, which was topped with a healthy amount of garlic, olive oil and cheese. The meatball slices on the meatball pizza are full of flavor.

Only minor challenge with this spot would be if you showed up when they were really busy. They aren't the most efficient at the counter, so I could imagine there are some long waits to order and get your food when busy.

It's definitely worth a try if you are in the area and need a snack/lunch and don't want to spend $30+ per person.",iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg,4,4/2/2015,2,review,0,Westside,Island Fusion

The food on the other hand left something to be desired.  I like the fact that they have a single page menu.  It can be questionable when restaurants have three or four page menus.  Although, if you only offer a one page menu, it should be mastered. Yeah, I said it.  The chef should be a straight up blind folded majician putting out dishes full of flavor.  
We started off with fried zucchini.  If you look at the appetizer menu, 8/10 choices are fried.  Now, I know this place isn't a health food restaurant, but I would have liked to see some variety.  The zucchini sticks were not very good.  The sticks had a crisp outside, but the inside had the texture of a worm.  I'm not a fan.  The sauce that was served with the fried zucchini wasn't anything special either.  
For a place that specialized in burgers, the burger was just okay.  We shared the ""steak house"" burger.  The description on the menu made it sound amazing.  This burger didn't wow me by any means.  I would eat a burger from In and Out over this anyday!  One part that stands out is limp lettuce.  I like the lettuce on a burger to crisp and fresh.  Sadly, this lettuce was warm and limp.  It wasn't all dissapointing, though.  The horseradish sauce was a nice touch and the cheese was melted nicely.  The burger itself was pretty juicy, too.  They also offer white or wheat buns.  The onions rings, a $2.50 subcharge, were pretty good.
To sum it up, LBS was just A-OK.  It wasn't great and it wasn't horrible either.  If I go back it would probably be for happy hour.",B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,3,2/21/2012,0,review,0,Southwest,Naked City Pizza Express

This pizza is pre cooked; and then re-heated; so first and foremost just notate that.

There is a Japanese man making the pizza; who's somewhat grumpy and awfully hard of hearing. 

My first and ONLY visit to this location (as I am a local to Vegas) I ordered 4 slices of Pepperoni. There were 4 available at that time. I went to the counter; paid, and waited. Soon thereafter since it was just a reheated slice; only 1 slice came out. I asked if the other remaining slices were on the way; and he immediately got defensive and told me that I had only ordered 1 slice. I showed him my receipt which validated that I ordered 4 slices; however at this point now; there were only 2 slices left. The other slices were being re heated for guests who had ordered and not yet paid behind me. I let the Manager know that because I not only asked specifically for the pepperoni, but also paid for it; that the remaining slices should be coming to me. She apologized and said that wasn't the way it worked; but that I was welcome to pick another slice instead. I let her know I wanted what I paid for and nothing more; to which she replied ""sorry"". I told her at that point to just give me a cheese; which was less expensive that the pepperoni. No refund was given for the difference in price.

I figured that this pizza had better be some damn good stuff for me to have had to put up with mediocre customer service; and $5 slices. It was AWFUL! Tasted as if it was reheated (which obviously it was)................sauce was nasty; almost Ragu tasting as funny as that sounds; and the cheese they use is either old or its just very cheap. This pizza was gross. Gross Gross Gross. I threw the remaining slices out, as not even the other Manager I work with wanted to eat anymore and felt the same. 

If you want GOOD AUTHENTIC PIZZA go to Sicili's on Twain Ave (Just behind the Venetian; passed Paradise. Its CHEAP, and its SO GOOD you'll crave it weekly (I'm not kidding you). $9 for a Large. And they slow churn their ranch every morning for the wings. (Owned by a small family)......................................

My first visit was during Yelp Helps week and it was a great setting to try this eatery since there were so many of us, which meant that we had the opportunity to try so many different pies (of course, that also meant we were stuffed!). That night, I tried eight of their pies, a couple appetizers, desserts, and a cocktail. Everything was so good that I returned just four days later with my fiance and friend Hally!

During my return visit, I had to order the Margherita ($16) again. The dough is hand-mixed with San Felice flour and proofed in Neapolitan wood boxes, then it's topped with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, Fior di Latte, Basil, EVOO, and sea salt. Finally, it's baked in a 900-degree Wood Stefano Ferrara oven. It's limited to 73 pies daily (although I heard they've gotten no where near that amount yet) and it won the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy. True Neopolitan pizza! 

The three of us also shared the Downtown ($19): Pepperoni, Molinari Salami, Bacon, Chives, Mushrooms, Red Onions, Bell Peppers, Black Olives, Italian Sausage, Cherry Tomatoes; which is one of their ""American Originals"" pizzas that all feature tomato sauce, mozzarella, and a rustic medium crust, baked in a gas brick oven at 550 degrees. As well as the Honey Pie ($17): Quail Hollow Farm Honey, Calabrese Peppers, Green Onions, Mozzarella, Piave Cheese, Fried Caramelized Onions, Serrano Peppers; one of their ""California"" pizzas that use Caputo Flour and baked in a 900-degree wood fire oven. 

The Downtown reminded me of a ""supreme/deluxe"" pizza, but definitely better. I had tried the Honey Pie during the first visit and although it wasn't one of my favorites that evening, I came to appreciate its flavors the second time around. I also tried their Classic Caesar salad ($10) and it was tasty. For drinks, I tried the Strawberry Fields Martini ($9.50): Stoli Strawberry, Strawberry Puree and a Hint of Mint and Hally ordered the Moscow Mule ($12): Stoli Vodka, Ginger Beer, and Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice. Both really delicious cocktails. 

From both visits, my favorite pizzas are the Margherita, Honey Pie, and New Yorker and I absolutely loved the Sweet Nothing cocktail, so good. I didn't care for the Calamari Fritti, Rosemary Garlic Fries, or the Mastunicola pizza. Anyway, I could eat that Margherita pizza every day. It's that good. I have to keep telling myself to not order it, just so I can try their other delicious concoctions (I have my eyes on the PIzza Campari, Clam and Garlic, and Proscuitto e Pomodorini). Hands down, definitely my favorite pizza joint now (sorry Grimaldi's). But seriously, award-winning pies, five different pizza ovens, quality ingredients - you're convinced right?

Parking is best on the surrounding streets like on Casino Center Blvd (meters take credit cards, yay, but you can only pay hourly at $1/hour) or free valet at The Downtown Grand (super easy and close).

I had the caipirinha which was good and hubby had the Asian Pear martini - which was very refreshing.  We were called to our table and, even though my husband had asked to sit next to me, they sat us at a small table where they then turned it on the longer side so we could sit next to one another.  Thankfully we like each other because we were definitely in each others space all night during dinner.  It really got to us when a couple came in 1/2 hour after us, no reservation and they get the 4-top right next to us and they sat next to each other.  Nice way to treat a reservation!  We had the Tuna Carpaccio (very good), the calamari tempura (eh, fried very crisp but the sauce wasn't great), Tuna and avocado Poke (very yummy).  We had ordered 2 rolls for dinner and a Sashimi plate with a side of rice.  They brought out the rice right away - and I had to send it back otherwise it would have gotten cold waiting on the entrees.  We got the Sashimi and it really was very fresh and tasty.  We had the black cod, yellowtail, ahi tuna and salmon.  Dude -- very fresh and really great cuts of fish.  We scarfed down the plate in no time.  We ordered hot sake as well and it comes in little baby bottles.  You would think it was made out of gold.  Then the waiter came by and asked if there was anything else we wanted -- he had forgotten our rolls.  Ok, just make us another sashimi plate -- yum.  Yes, it was that good to order it again.  

The food was good, the place is very pretty but there really is no one managing the place thats a ""grown up"".  The girls at the hostess stand were way too young to call the shots and the waitstaff is very young as well -- they need a manager.  I think there are alot of places out there where you can get really good fresh Sushi. The service here really lacked -- and this place is not cheap.  Oh, and hey guys?  The people you sat at the 4-top ate one appetizer, one round of drinks and they split one entree.  They spent about half what we did -- and I'm sure they'll be back.

There is a very small self-park lot out front and a garage adjacent to the hotel.  The garage is very high - maybe like 7-8 stories but is so freakishly small.  After spending 10 minutes try to find a parking spot on the 7th floor, my friends and I enter the elevators and pray not to die as the shaft is shaking and making funny weird noises.  Besides praying for our safety,    we are holding our breath because there is a smell combination of vomit, urine, and shit - no kidding!  Anyways, besides the parking situation, the casino is small and decent.  They were running this suited blackjack promotion where if you got a suited bj, you got a free Rush Hour 3 DVD.  My friends and I ended up winning around 10 and selling them to tourists from Canada for a few bucks. 

Moving on, I did not stay in their hotel rooms but based on the casino, I would much rather go somewhere else unless its free.

First, the counter staff was very friendly and helpful!  There are so many different options on their menu for chicken salad with various seasonings and flavors! (Personally, I'm perplexed with some of the reviews here that focus on recipe for a particular type chicken salad!  For heaven's sake, they only have 15 different salads! If you picked one that was bland, you shoulda' tried it first and picked another!) They offer free samples to make sure you get the recipe that's right for you! I settled on the Chick Trio so that I could enjoy several. I personally selected Barbie-Q, Olivia's Old South, and Jalapeno Holly. All were very good and I would order them again. My favorite (so far, having only tried 3!) was the Jalapeno Holly - perfect balance of jalapeno; not overpowering.
Now, the price per pound is a little high compared to chicken salad you get in other places. But, BUT, you're in a restaurant where you can pick and choose from lots of recipes to get that salad that you desire most! I like that!!  AND, frankly, I pay more when I order chicken salad on a sandwich anywhere else, or but it by the scoop from the nearby deli! So, I'm fine with their prices given the selection and the quality.

There appears a large selection on the menu - I find most of the items rather un-inspiring. There is the tendancy to go with large portions rather than quality food. maybe I'm expecting too much, but I'd hope for a few dishes that were a bit more inspired.
My test of a restaurant is what they offer for vegetarians and they fall flat on their face for that. 
Salad dressings are poor, soups are generally too salty and many dishes very heavy.
Have to say most of the folks I go with seem to like the restaurant.

The Street Treats...

... sorry, my keyboard shorted from me drooling in remembrance.  Marinated and seared to perfection, they were savory and ever so slightly spicy.  I could make a whole meal around just them.  At $4 a pop for an order, they are worth every cent, and that's saying a lot given this economy!

The dumplings were good, if a tad underseasoned.  They had been steamed and then seared as any proper potsticker should be, but had a limp feel to them.   Also, they didn't come with any of the traditional soy/scallion dipping sauces that generally accompany dumplings. The order of 6 was $7.  A tad over priced given what I got and should probably be in the $5-6 range.

I was also disappointed that, given a name like Hao Bao,  they didn't actually serve the steamed bun Bao that I'd been so eager to try.

All that being said, I would visit them again (and will be tomorrow night) as I'd like to try their Scallion Pancakes and the Noodle Soup.

Fresh Greek yogurt.  Ample fruit.  Bottomless coffee.  And a large glass of grapefruit juice.

The reason why I rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal.  I've always felt like an outsider here, even when we were going once or twice a week for months.  (We live right down the street.)  

The hosts are terrible - it's like they look right past you if you're not one of their Special Friends and they shoehorn you into tiny and uncomfortable booths while putting smaller parties into comfortable and spacious booths.

However, Burrito by itself tasted bland and had more tofu taste. Spicy sauce is very spicy so be careful. Veggie Loaded Nacho was good. Not great though! Enchiladas is good. However, my in-law had ordered some chicken plate and was very dry and we had to replace it with another enchilada. First it took them a while to get his order out and then to find it was all dry. Then by the time enchilada came, not much hunger or mood left! However, their dessert dried ice-cream was really good. The cancelled item showed up on the receipt and we asked them to cancel it which they honored. 
Friendly customer service. But overall food was okay. Definitely try their Fried Ice-Cream!

The ONLY reason I go is because they make very good peanut butter cookies, I've tried to make them on my own or look for them elsewhere but am unable too.

First off they are very over priced, I know it's Scottsdale but come on! $10 for a smoothie!

second there customer service is just awful.  I know this because I have experience and witnessed happen on more than one occasion.  If someone is spending almost $50 at your juice bar show some interest.   I get the feeling the people who work here don't need the money  or the job but instead run it as a hobby. 

Finally I COULD overlook all this but there hours are different than the one listed online. Like why would they do that? it's confusing and irritating!

The last visit I made to Gertrude's gave me a great picture of the way the staff makes sure things stay right.
Three of us went in Easter morning for a snack. None of us were hungry enough for a full meal, but wanted something. We each had the fresh lemonade with herbs and berries (I am not generally a fan of lemonade, but this was fantastic), and decided to share the special of hot cross buns with cinnamon butter and the garden frittata.
The room is casual and comfortable, with a fantastic patio. The food was fresh, well prepared and beautifully presented. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. I thought the prices were high for the quantity served, but much like resort dining, you are paying for the location. I wanted to treat the gals to our snack, so I slipped the server my debit card.
All was well until he brought the check. It wasn't the card receipt for me to sign, it was the check. I reminded him about my card, he acknowledged and walked away. A few minutes later, the manager came over. It seems my card was misplaced. She gave me her business card, apologized, comped the bill and was taking down my contact information when the server came back - having found my card.
Naturally, I was relieved. I was also surprised and impressed that they still insisted on not charging us for the meal. 
With how promptly and professionally it was handled, and the great customer service that was shown - in addition to the fact I thoroughly enjoyed all I ate and drank while there - I will definitely be back - probably every time I go to the Garden!",UNfiku8qEyvGYjPK7w_gxQ,4,4/16/2015,1,review,1,The Strip,KGB: Kerry's Gourmet Burgers

We arrived in time for Happy Hour and ordered a number of items from the discounted HH menu -- gyoza, sliders, shrimp tempura, fire dragon rolls and calamari. They brought everything at once -- it hardly fit on the table. Since everything was cooked, by the time we got around to eating it, after trying to organize the platters and dishes on the table, everything was cold. Most of the dishes were tasty, but the soggy calamari with asian pesto dipping sauce was abominable! We also had the sashimi platter and tuna tataki. As always, the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth.

I have always been a huge fan of Pure Sushi . . . but the service we received on an early Tuesday evening was mediocre at best. At three minutes after 6 pm (the end of HH), our server asked if we wanted another drink. Three minutes after 6!!!  A conscientious server would have come by three minutes to 6 and said, HH is over in a few minutes, would you like to order another drink, or last call for HH . . . and then, as I wrote above, all the items coming out at one time . . . should never have happened that way.

All that being said, I have searching a place that serves great burgers.  I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that I order a burger.  So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  I expected a dive with somewhat gruff service.  Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight.  And the service was tremendous.  Yes it was a Thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! That makes sense to me.  No use taking up a table with a partial party who is ""faffing."" (Google term if confused)
  
I had a medium rare burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  The beef was good!!  This means a lot coming from me a non-meat eater.  The wood fire grill gave a super flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly to temperature.  My veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies, not a mush of frozen overcooked goop.  Mr. Handsome devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction.  Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.

Will be recommending Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!

18511,2,#NAME?,CiWIv7By57EDW_AAqAAAWg,"It was decided that the culmination of our Southwest trip would involve a ""grand finale"" for Mexican dining, so the burden was on the Yelp iPhone App as we sped toward Phoenix looking for a solid lunch place near the airport. Given that Yelp never fails, the deceptively named La Tolteca Mexican Foods was presented before us as an attractive option. Hesitant as to whether it was actually just a Mexican grocery store, we hustled in to see what the buzz was about. Now, I know I live in the Northeast (veritable Mexican food desert), but ""Oh. My. Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" This place is amazing. 

One of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it. Back to the food though... that really was the main event. I ordered a chicken burrito which came out quickly and was f---ing enormous. Imagine the beams of light shining down from above when I turned around a spotted the salsa bar! I was able to taste all of their salsas including the piquant green chili pepper one which I am still thinking about. There's a vast dining area to the back where you can bring your food and beverage to gorge and take in this amazing experience. Maybe I just love Mexican food too much... Who knows, but I was really a happy camper here. 

We looked over and spotted some people eating burritos that were literally the size of loaves of Wonder Bread, so consider that as one more reason to go (though even I, self-proclaimed food eater extraordinaire could not fathom eating one of those). The prices are ridiculously cheap, and the food was amazing, flavorful and truly memorable.
